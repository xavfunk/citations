  abstract = "Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a neurotransmitter and
              hormone that contributes to the regulation of various
              physiological functions by its actions in the central nervous
              system (CNS) and in the respective organ systems. Peripheral 5-HT
              is predominantly produced by enterochromaffin (EC) cells of the
              gastrointestinal (GI) tract. These gut-resident cells produce
              much more 5-HT than all neuronal and other sources combined,
              establishing EC cells as the main source of this biogenic amine
              in the human body. Peripheral 5-HT is also a potent immune
              modulator and affects various immune cells through its receptors
              and via the recently identified process of serotonylation.
              Alterations in 5-HT signalling have been described in
              inflammatory conditions of the gut, such as inflammatory bowel
              disease. The association between 5-HT and inflammation, however,
              is not limited to the gut, as changes in 5-HT levels have also
              been reported in patients with allergic airway inflammation and
              rheumatoid arthritis. Based on searches for terms such as '5-HT',
              'EC cell', 'immune cells' and 'inflammation' in pubmed.gov as

              Effective psychotherapeutic treatments for depression exist;
              however, data on their long-term effectiveness beyond a time span
              of two years is still scarce. Our aim was to perform a
              meta-analysis, investigating (a) overall rates of relapse more
              than two years after psychotherapy (meta-analysis 1), and (b) if
              psychotherapy has more enduring effects than
              non-psychotherapeutic comparison conditions (e.g.
              pharmacotherapy, treatment as usual), again beyond a time span of
              two years post-therapy (meta-analysis 2). METHODS: We searched
              electronic databases Medline, PsycINFO and the COCHRANE Library.
              Main selection criteria were (i) RCT of psychotherapy with
              follow-up interval of more than 2 years, (ii) primary diagnosis
              of depression, assessed by observer ratings, (iii) report of
              relapse at follow-up. RESULTS: We identified 11 studies, 6 of
              which included a non-psychotherapeutic comparison condition.
              Together they comprised long-term data of 966 patients. Mean
              follow-up duration was 4.4 years. The overall relapse rate at
              long-term follow-up was 0.39 (95\% CI 0.29, 0.50). Psychotherapy
              resulted in significantly less relapses (53.1\% vs. 71.1\%, OR
              0.51; 95\% CI 0.32, 0.82, p=0.005) than comparison treatments.
              This finding corresponded to a number needed to treat (NNT) of
              5.55. LIMITATIONS: Results can only be preliminary as data was
              sparse and studies differed methodologically. Heterogeneity in
              the first meta-analysis was high (I(2)=82\%). Results indicated
              publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: The relapse rate more than two
              years after psychotherapy is relatively high, but significantly
              lower compared to non-psychotherapeutic treatments. Multiannual
              follow-ups should routinely be included in future psychotherapy
              RCTs.",

              general population. Studies suggest that major depression is
              accompanied by immune dysregulation and activation of the
              inflammatory response system (IRS). Our objective was to
              quantitatively summarize the data on concentrations of specific
              cytokines in patients diagnosed with a major depressive episode
              and controls. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of studies
              measuring cytokine concentration in patients with major
              depression, with a database search of the English literature (to
              August 2009) and a manual search of references. RESULTS:
              Twenty-four studies involving unstimulated measurements of
              cytokines in patients meeting DSM criteria for major depression
              were included in the meta-analysis; 13 for tumor necrosis factor
              (TNF)-alpha, 9 for interleukin (IL)-1beta, 16 for IL-6, 5 for
              IL-4, 5 for IL-2, 4 for IL-8, 6 for IL-10, and 4 for interferon
              (IFN)-gamma. There were significantly higher concentrations of
              TNF-alpha (p < .00001), weighted mean difference (WMD) (95\%
              confidence interval) 3.97 pg/mL (2.24 to 5.71), in depressed
              subjects compared with control subjects (438 depressed/350
              nondepressed). Also, IL-6 concentrations were significantly
              higher (p < .00001) in depressed subjects compared with control
              subjects (492 depressed/400 nondepressed) with an overall WMD of
              1.78 pg/mL (1.23 to 2.33). There were no significant differences
              among depressed and nondepressed subjects for the other cytokines
              studied. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis reports significantly
              higher concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha
              and IL-6 in depressed subjects compared with control subjects.
              While both positive and negative results have been reported in
              individual studies, this meta-analytic result strengthens
              evidence that depression is accompanied by activation of the IRS.",

  abstract = "The classic serotonergic hallucinogens, or psychedelics, have the
              ability to profoundly alter perception and behavior. These can
              include visual distortions, hallucinations, detachment from
              reality, and mystical experiences. Some psychedelics, like LSD,
              are able to produce these effects with remarkably low doses of
              drug. Others, like psilocybin, have recently been demonstrated to
              have significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of
              depression, anxiety, and addiction that persist for at least
              several months after only a single therapeutic session. How does
              this occur? Much work has recently been published from imaging
              studies showing that psychedelics alter brain network
              connectivity. They facilitate a disintegration of the default
              mode network, producing a hyperconnectivity between brain regions
              that allow centers that do not normally communicate with each
              other to do so. The immediate and acute effects on both behaviors
              and network connectivity are likely mediated by effector pathways
              downstream of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation. These acute
              molecular processes also influence gene expression changes, which
              likely influence synaptic plasticity and facilitate more
              long-term changes in brain neurochemistry ultimately underlying
              the therapeutic efficacy of a single administration to achieve
              long-lasting effects. In this review, we summarize what is
              currently known about the molecular genetic responses to
              psychedelics within the brain and discuss how gene expression
              changes may contribute to altered cellular physiology and

              in both humans and animals1. Unlike most medications for the
              treatment of substance use disorders, anecdotal reports suggest
              that ibogaine has the potential to treat addiction to various
              substances, including opiates, alcohol and psychostimulants. The
              effects of ibogaine-like those of other psychedelic compounds-are
              long-lasting2, which has been attributed to its ability to modify
              addiction-related neural circuitry through the activation of
              neurotrophic factor signalling3,4. However, several safety
              concerns have hindered the clinical development of ibogaine,
              including its toxicity, hallucinogenic potential and tendency to
              induce cardiac arrhythmias. Here we apply the principles of
              function-oriented synthesis to identify the key structural
              elements of the potential therapeutic pharmacophore of ibogaine,
              and we use this information to engineer tabernanthalog-a
              water-soluble, non-hallucinogenic, non-toxic analogue of ibogaine
              that can be prepared in a single step. In rodents, tabernanthalog
              was found to promote structural neural plasticity, reduce
              alcohol- and heroin-seeking behaviour, and produce
              antidepressant-like effects. This work demonstrates that, through
              careful chemical design, it is possible to modify a psychedelic
              compound to produce a safer, non-hallucinogenic variant that has
              therapeutic potential.",

              biases toward negatively toned emotional information are common,
              but are they a cause or a consequence of depressive symptoms?
              Here, we propose a 'cognitive neuropsychological' model of
              depression, suggesting that negative information processing
              biases have a central causal role in the development of symptoms
              of depression, and that treatments exert their beneficial effects
              by abolishing these biases. We review the evidence pertaining to
              this model: briefly with respect to currently depressed patients,
              and in more detail with respect to individuals at risk for
              depression and the effects of antidepressant treatments. As well
              as being present in currently depressed individuals, negative
              biases are detectable in those vulnerable for depression due to
              neuroticism, genetic risk, or previous depressive illness. Recent
              evidence provides strong support for the notion that both
              antidepressant drugs and psychological therapies modify negative
              biases, providing a common mechanism for understanding treatments
              for depression. Intriguingly, it may even be possible to predict
              which patients will benefit most from which treatments on the
              basis of neural responses to negative stimuli. However, further
              research is required to ascertain whether negative processing
              biases will be useful in predicting, detecting, and treating

Here we outline the conceptual and practical advantages of an alternative analysis method: Bayesian hypothesis testing and model selection using the Bayes factor. In contrast to pNHST, Bayes factors allow researchers to quantify evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. Also, Bayes factors do not require adjustment for the intention with which the data were collected. The use of Bayes factors is demonstrated through an extended example for hierarchical regression based on the design of an experiment recently published in the Journal of Management. This example also highlights the fact that p values overestimate the evidence against the null hypothesis, misleading researchers into believing that their findings are more reliable than is warranted by the data. }

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A recent open-label pilot study (N = 15) found that
              two to three moderate to high doses (20 and 30 mg/70 kg) of the
              serotonin 2A receptor agonist, psilocybin, in combination with
              cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking cessation,
              resulted in substantially higher 6-month smoking abstinence rates
              than are typically observed with other medications or CBT alone.
              OBJECTIVES: To assess long-term effects of a
              psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation program at $\geq$12
              months after psilocybin administration. METHODS: The present
              report describes biologically verified smoking abstinence
              outcomes of the previous pilot study at $\geq$12 months, and
              related data on subjective effects of psilocybin. RESULTS: All 15
              participants completed a 12-month follow-up, and 12 (80\%)
              returned for a long-term ($\geq$16 months) follow-up, with a mean
              interval of 30 months (range = 16-57 months) between target-quit
              date (i.e., first psilocybin session) and long-term follow-up. At
              12-month follow-up, 10 participants (67\%) were confirmed as
              smoking abstinent. At long-term follow-up, nine participants
              (60\%) were confirmed as smoking abstinent. At 12-month follow-up
              13 participants (86.7\%) rated their psilocybin experiences among
              the five most personally meaningful and spiritually significant
              experiences of their lives. CONCLUSION: These results suggest
              that in the context of a structured treatment program, psilocybin
              holds considerable promise in promoting long-term smoking
              abstinence. The present study adds to recent and historical

              MEASURES: The sample (N = 1160) constituted three groups: people
              quarantined in an affected area, unaffected areas, and people not
              in quarantine. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression
              Scale (CES-D-20) and the Goldberg Depression and Anxiety Scale
              (GAD-7) were administered as measures of depression and anxiety,

              regression identified factors associated with depression and
              anxiety. RESULTS: Probable depression and anxiety were reported
              by 26.47\% and 70.78\% of all respondents, respectively. After
              adjusting for demographic and community variables, quarantined

              with treatment-resistant depression. Patients received a single
              dose of either ayahuasca or placebo. We assessed changes in
              depression severity with the Montgomery-{\AA}sberg Depression
              Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Hamilton Depression Rating scale at
              baseline, and at 1 (D1), 2 (D2), and 7 (D7) days after dosing.
              RESULTS: We observed significant antidepressant effects of

              stimuli-is an essential aspect of healthy brain function and, in
              principle, can be harnessed to promote recovery from a wide
              variety of brain disorders. Many neuropsychiatric diseases
              including mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders arise from
              an inability to weaken and/or strengthen pathologic and
              beneficial circuits, respectively, ultimately leading to
              maladaptive behavioral responses. Thus, compounds capable of
              facilitating the structural and functional reorganization of
              neural circuits to produce positive behavioral effects have broad
              therapeutic potential. Several known drugs and experimental
              therapeutics have been shown to promote plasticity, but most rely
              on indirect mechanisms and are slow-acting. Here, I describe
              psychoplastogens-a relatively new class of fast-acting
              therapeutics, capable of rapidly promoting structural and
              functional neural plasticity. Psychoplastogenic compounds include
              psychedelics, ketamine, and several other recently discovered

              little evidence that they have a specific pharmacological effect
              relative to pill placebo for patients with less severe
              depression. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the relative benefit of
              medication vs placebo across a wide range of initial symptom
              severity in patients diagnosed with depression. DATA SOURCES:
              PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library databases were
              searched from January 1980 through March 2009, along with
              references from meta-analyses and reviews. STUDY SELECTION:
              Randomized placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants approved
              by the Food and Drug Administration in the treatment of major or
              minor depressive disorder were selected. Studies were included if
              their authors provided the requisite original data, they
              comprised adult outpatients, they included a medication vs
              placebo comparison for at least 6 weeks, they did not exclude
              patients on the basis of a placebo washout period, and they used
              the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Data from 6 studies
              (718 patients) were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Individual
              patient-level data were obtained from study authors. RESULTS:
              Medication vs placebo differences varied substantially as a
              function of baseline severity. Among patients with HDRS scores
              below 23, Cohen d effect sizes for the difference between
              medication and placebo were estimated to be less than 0.20 (a
              standard definition of a small effect). Estimates of the
              magnitude of the superiority of medication over placebo increased
              with increases in baseline depression severity and crossed the
              threshold defined by the National Institute for Clinical
              Excellence for a clinically significant difference at a baseline
              HDRS score of 25. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of benefit of
              antidepressant medication compared with placebo increases with
              severity of depression symptoms and may be minimal or
              nonexistent, on average, in patients with mild or moderate
              symptoms. For patients with very severe depression, the benefit
              of medications over placebo is substantial.",

  author   = "Kendler, K S and Karkowski, L M and Prescott, C A",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Stressful life events are associated with the onset of
              episodes of major depression. However, exposure to stressful life
              events is influenced by genetic factors, and these factors are
              correlated with those that predispose to major depression. The
              aim of this study was to clarify the degree to which stressful
              life events cause major depression. METHOD: The authors assessed
              the occurrence of 15 classes of stressful life events and the
              onset of DSM-III-R major depression over a 1-year period in
              female twins ascertained from a population-based registry. The
              sample contained 24,648 person-months and 316 onsets of major
              depression. Stressful life events were individually rated on
              contextual threat and dependence (the degree to which the
              stressful life event could have resulted from the respondent's
              behavior). The nature of the relationship between stressful life
              events and major depression was tested by 1) discrete-time
              survival analysis examining the relationship between dependence
              and the depressogenic effect of stressful life events and 2) a
              co-twin control analysis. RESULTS: While independent stressful
              life events were significantly associated with onsets of
              depression, when level of threat was controlled, the association
              was significantly stronger for dependent events. The odds ratio
              for onset of major depression in the month of a stressful life
              event was 5.64 in all subjects, 4.52 within dizygotic pairs, and
              3.58 within monozygotic pairs. CONCLUSIONS: Stressful life events
              have a substantial causal relationship with the onset of episodes
              of major depression. However, about one-third of the association
              between stressful life events and onsets of depression is
              noncausal, since individuals predisposed to major depression
              select themselves into high-risk environments.",

              various mechanisms to increase synaptic concentrations of
              monoamines. This finding led to the adoption of the monoamine
              hypothesis of depression, first put forward over 30 years ago,
              which proposes that the underlying biological or neuroanatomical
              basis for depression is a deficiency of central noradrenergic
              and/or serotonergic systems and that targeting this neuronal
              lesion with an antidepressant would tend to restore normal
              function in depressed patients. The hypothesis has enjoyed
              considerable support, since it attempts to provide a
              pathophysiologic explanation of the actions of antidepressants.
              However, in its original form it is clearly inadequate, as it
              does not provide a complete explanation for the actions of
              antidepressants, and the pathophysiology of depression itself
              remains unknown. The hypothesis has evolved over the years to
              include, for example, adaptive changes in receptors to explain
              why there should be only a gradual clinical response to
              antidepressant treatment when the increase in availability of
              monoamines is rapid. Still, the monoamine hypothesis does not
              address key issues such as why antidepressants are also effective
              in other disorders such as panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive
              disorder, and bulimia, or why all drugs that enhance serotonergic

              inflammatory response triggered by pro-inflammatory cytokines in
              the periphery, free radicals, oxidants and glucocorticoids are
              over-produced, which can affect glial cell functions and damage
              neurons in the brain. Indeed, decreased neurogenesis and the
              dysfunction of neurotrophic system (up- or down-regulations of
              neurotrophins and their receptors) have been recently found.
              Effective treatments for depressive symptoms, such as
              antidepressants and omega-3 fatty acids can increase or modulate
              neurotrophic system and enhance neurogenesis. However, the
              relationship between glial cells; microglia (mostly involved in
              neuroinflammation) and astrocytes (producing neurotrophins), and
              the contribution of inflammation to decreased neurogenesis and
              dysfunction of neurotrophic system are almost unknown. This
              review first introduces changes in behavior, neurotransmitter,
              cytokine and neurogenesis aspects in depressed patients and
              several animal models of depression, secondly explores the
              possible relationship between pro- and anti-inflammatory
              cytokines and neurogenesis in these models, then discusses the
              effects of current treatments on inflammation, neurotrophic
              system and neurogenesis, and finally pointes out the limitations
              and future research directions.",

              low serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations
              in depressed patients and normalization of this by antidepressant
              treatment. These findings are believed to reflect peripheral
              manifestations of the neurotrophin hypothesis, which states that
              depression is secondary to an altered expression of BDNF in the
              brain. Since the publication of these meta-analyses, the field
              has seen a huge increase in studies on these topics. This
              motivated us to update the evidence on the aforementioned
              associations and, in addition, to compile the data on serum BDNF
              concentrations in relation to the symptom severity of depression.
              Using a manifold of data as compared with earlier meta-analyses,
              we find low serum BDNF concentrations in 2384 antidepressant-free
              depressed patients relative to 2982 healthy controls and to 1249
              antidepressant-treated depressed patients (Cohen's d=-0.71 and
              -0.56, P-values <0.0000001). When publication bias is accounted
              for, these effect-sizes become substantially smaller (d=-0.47 and
              -0.34, respectively, P-values<0.0001). We detect between-study
              heterogeneity in outcomes for which only year of publication and
              sample size are significant moderators, with more recent papers
              and larger samples sizes in general being associated with smaller
              between-group differences. Finally, the aggregated data negate
              consistent associations between serum BDNF concentrations and the
              symptom severity of depression. Our findings corroborate the
              claim that altered serum BDNF concentrations are peripheral
              manifestations of depression. However, here we highlight that the
              evidence for this claim is slimmer as was initially thought and

  abstract = "CONTEXT: Existing therapies for major depression have a lag of
              onset of action of several weeks, resulting in considerable
              morbidity. Exploring pharmacological strategies that have rapid
              onset of antidepressant effects within a few days and that are
              sustained would have an enormous impact on patient care.
              Converging lines of evidence suggest the role of the
              glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology and treatment of mood
              disorders. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a rapid antidepressant
              effect can be achieved with an antagonist at the
              N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in subjects with major depression.
              DESIGN: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover
              study from November 2004 to September 2005. SETTING: Mood
              Disorders Research Unit at the National Institute of Mental
              Health. Patients Eighteen subjects with DSM-IV major depression
              (treatment resistant). INTERVENTIONS: After a 2-week drug-free
              period, subjects were given an intravenous infusion of either
              ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo on 2 test days, a
              week apart. Subjects were rated at baseline and at 40, 80, 110,
              and 230 minutes and 1, 2, 3, and 7 days postinfusion. Main
              Outcome Measure Changes in scores on the primary efficacy
              measure, the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS:
              Subjects receiving ketamine showed significant improvement in
              depression compared with subjects receiving placebo within 110
              minutes after injection, which remained significant throughout
              the following week. The effect size for the drug difference was
              very large (d = 1.46 [95\% confidence interval, 0.91-2.01]) after
              24 hours and moderate to large (d = 0.68 [95\% confidence
              interval, 0.13-1.23]) after 1 week. Of the 17 subjects treated
              with ketamine, 71\% met response and 29\% met remission criteria
              the day following ketamine infusion. Thirty-five percent of
              subjects maintained response for at least 1 week. CONCLUSIONS:
              Robust and rapid antidepressant effects resulted from a single
              intravenous dose of an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist; onset
              occurred within 2 hours postinfusion and continued to remain
              significant for 1 week.",

              anhedonia; anxiety-like behaviors; fatigue and somatic symptoms,
              e.g. illness behavior or malaise; and mild cognitive impairment
              (MCI). These effects are in part mediated by increased levels of
              pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs), e.g. interleukin-1 (IL-1),
              IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)$\alpha$, and Th-1-derived
              cytokines, such as IL-2 and interferon (IFN)$\gamma$. Moreover,
              new pathways, i.e. concomitants and sequels of CMI activation and
              inflammation, were detected in depression: (1) Induction of
              indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) by IFN$\gamma$ and some PICs is
              associated with depleted plasma tryptophan, which may interfere
              with brain 5-HT synthesis, and increased production of anxiogenic
              and depressogenic tryptophan catabolites. (2) Increased bacterial
              translocation may cause depression-like behaviors by activating
              the cytokine network, oxidative and nitrosative stress (O\&NS)
              pathways and IDO. (3) Induction of O\&NS causes damage to
              membrane $\omega$3 PUFAs, functional proteins, DNA and
              mitochondria, and autoimmune responses directed against
              intracellular molecules that may cause dysfunctions in
              intracellular signaling. (4) Decreased levels of $\omega$3 PUFAs
              and antioxidants, such as coenzyme Q10, glutathione peroxidase or
              zinc, are associated with an increased inflammatory potential;
              more oxidative damage; the onset of specific symptoms; and
              changes in the expression or functions of brain 5-HT and
              N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. (5) All abovementioned factors
              cause neuroprogression, that is a combination of
              neurodegeneration, neuronal apoptosis, and lowered neurogenesis
              and neuroplasticity. It is concluded that depression may be the
              consequence of a complex interplay between CMI activation and
              inflammation and their sequels/concomitants which all together
              cause neuroprogression that further shapes the depression
              phenotype. Future research should employ high throughput
              technologies to collect genetic and gene expression and protein
              data from patients with depression and analyze these data by
              means of systems biology methods to define the dynamic
              interactions between the different cell signaling networks and
              O\&NS pathways that cause depression.",

              under controlled experimental conditions in humans, and evidence
              is beginning to emerge showing that circulating inflammatory
              factors respond to acute psychological stress under laboratory
              conditions. However, research published to date has varied
              greatly in the composition of study groups, the timing of
              samples, assay methods, and the type of challenge imposed. The
              purpose of this review is to synthesize existing data using
              meta-analytic techniques. Thirty studies met inclusion criteria.
              Results showed robust effects for increased levels of circulating
              IL-6 (r=0.19, p=0.001) and IL-1beta (r=0.58, p<0.001) following
              acute stress, and marginal effects for CRP (r=0.12, p=0.088). The
              effects of stress on stimulated cytokine production were less
              consistent. Significant variation in the inflammatory response
              was also related to the health status of participants and the
              timing of post-stress samples. A number of psychobiological
              mechanisms may underlie responses, including stress-induced
              reductions in plasma volume, upregulation of synthesis, or
              enlargement of the cell pool contributing to synthesis. The acute
              stress-induced inflammatory response may have implications for

              the effects they experienced when they last took a hallucinogen,

              been used in scientific literature, but so far it has not been
              explicitly defined. This review article attempts to elucidate the
              SV concept. SV can be defined as increased sensitivity to natural
              or experimental alterations of the serotonergic (5-HTergic)
              system. Several factors that may disrupt the 5-HTergic system and
              hence contribute to SV are discussed, including genetic factors,
              female gender, personality characteristics, several types of
              stress and drug use. It is explained that SV can be demonstrated
              by means of manipulations of the 5-HTergic system, such as 5-HT
              challenges or acute tryptophan depletion (ATD). Results of 5-HT
              challenge studies and ATD studies are discussed in terms of their
              implications for the concept of SV. A model is proposed in which
              a combination of various factors that may compromise 5-HT
              functioning in one person can result in depression or other
              5-HT-related pathology. By manipulating 5-HT levels, in
              particular with ATD, vulnerable subjects may be identified before
              pathology initiates, providing the opportunity to take preventive
              action. Although it is not likely that this model applies to all
              cases of depression, or is able to identify all vulnerable
              subjects, the strength of the model is that it may enable

              to neuroendocrine substrates (e.g. corticotropin releasing
              hormone, and corticoids) and central neurotransmitters (serotonin
              and GABA), alterations of neuronal plasticity or even neuronal
              survival may play a role in depression. Indeed, depression and
              chronic stressor exposure typically reduce levels of growth
              factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor and
              anti-apoptotic factors (e.g. bcl-2), as well as impair processes
              of neuronal branching and neurogenesis. Although such effects may
              result from elevated corticoids, they may also stem from
              activation of the inflammatory immune system, particularly the
              immune signaling cytokines. In fact, several proinflammatory
              cytokines, such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and
              interferon-gamma, influence neuronal functioning through
              processes involving apoptosis, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress
              and metabolic derangement. Support for the involvement of
              cytokines in depression comes from studies showing their
              elevation in severe depressive illness and following stressor
              exposure, and that cytokine immunotherapy (e.g. interferon-alpha)
              elicited depressive symptoms that were amenable to antidepressant
              treatment. It is suggested that stressors and cytokines share a
              common ability to impair neuronal plasticity and at the same time
              altering neurotransmission, ultimately contributing to
              depression. Thus, depressive illness may be considered a disorder
              of neuroplasticity as well as one of neurochemical imbalances,
              and cytokines may act as mediators of both aspects of this

              religious purposes, little is known scientifically about its
              acute and persisting effects. OBJECTIVES: This double-blind study
              evaluated the acute and longer-term psychological effects of a
              high dose of psilocybin relative to a comparison compound
              administered under comfortable, supportive conditions. MATERIALS
              AND METHODS: The participants were hallucinogen-na{\"\i}ve adults
              reporting regular participation in religious or spiritual
              activities. Two or three sessions were conducted at 2-month
              intervals. Thirty volunteers received orally administered
              psilocybin (30 mg/70 kg) and methylphenidate hydrochloride (40
              mg/70 kg) in counterbalanced order. To obscure the study design,
              six additional volunteers received methylphenidate in the first
              two sessions and unblinded psilocybin in a third session. The 8-h
              sessions were conducted individually. Volunteers were encouraged
              to close their eyes and direct their attention inward. Study
              monitors rated volunteers' behavior during sessions. Volunteers
              completed questionnaires assessing drug effects and mystical
              experience immediately after and 2 months after sessions.
              Community observers rated changes in the volunteer's attitudes
              and behavior. RESULTS: Psilocybin produced a range of acute
              perceptual changes, subjective experiences, and labile moods
              including anxiety. Psilocybin also increased measures of mystical
              experience. At 2 months, the volunteers rated the psilocybin
              experience as having substantial personal meaning and spiritual
              significance and attributed to the experience sustained positive
              changes in attitudes and behavior consistent with changes rated
              by community observers. CONCLUSIONS: When administered under
              supportive conditions, psilocybin occasioned experiences similar
              to spontaneously occurring mystical experiences. The ability to
              occasion such experiences prospectively will allow rigorous

              neuroendocrine systems is, however, bidirectional. The endocrine
              and immune systems share a common ``chemical language,'' with
              both systems possessing ligands and receptors of ``classical''
              hormones and immunoregulatory mediators. Studies in the early to
              mid 1980s demonstrated that monocyte-derived or recombinant
              interleukin-1 (IL-1) causes secretion of hormones of the
              hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, establishing that

              bidirectional communication between the immune and neuroendocrine
              systems. The subsequent 10-15 years have witnessed demonstrations
              that numerous members of several cytokine families increase the
              secretory activity of the HPA axis. Because this neuroendocrine
              action of cytokines is mediated primarily at the level of the

              review of articles published between January 1967 and January
              2008 in the PubMed and PsycINFO electronic databases was
              performed. Effect sizes were calculated as stat d and
              meta-analyzed, using random-effects models. RESULTS: Each
              inflammatory marker was positively associated with depression;
              CRP, d = 0.15 (95\% CI = 0.10, 0.21), p < .001; IL-6, d = 0.25

              Associations were strongest in clinically depressed patient
              samples--but were also significant in community-based
              samples--and when clinical interviews were used. Studies
              adjusting for body mass index (BMI) had smaller associations,
              albeit significant. Relationships were inconsistent with respect
              to age, medication, and sex. Depression was related to CRP and

              Depression and CRP, IL-1, and IL-6 are positively associated in

              populations. Available evidence is consistent with three causal

               albeit crucial questions. First, the question of the specificity
               of the serotonergic responses to stress, with regard to the site
               of action and the nature of the stressor still remains open due
               to the heterogeneity of the results obtained so far. This could
               indicate that environmental factors, other than the stressor
               itself, may have enduring consequences on 5-HT sensitivity to
               stress. Second, the question regarding the role of
               stresselicited changes in 5-HT transmission within coping
               processes finds in most cases no clearcut answer. In keeping
               with human symptomatology, the need to consider the environment
               (including the early one) and the genetic status when assessing
               the effects of stress on 5-HT neurotransmission is underlined.
               Such a consideration could help to answer the questions raised.",

              large, significant effects for LSD efficacy compared to control

              effects of LSD and mechanistically-related classic psychedelics

              supplement clinical studies, reports of psychedelic use in
              naturalistic settings can provide further data regarding
              potential effects of psychedelics on alcohol use. METHODS: An
              anonymous online survey of individuals with prior AUD reporting
              cessation or reduction in alcohol use following psychedelic use
              in non-clinical settings. RESULTS: 343 respondents, mostly White
              (89\%), males (78\%), in the USA (60\%) completed the survey.
              Participants reported seven years of problematic alcohol use on
              average before the psychedelic experience to which they
              attributed reduced alcohol consumption, with 72\% meeting
              retrospective criteria for severe AUD. Most reported taking a
              moderate or high dose of LSD (38\%) or psilocybin (36\%),
              followed by significant reduction in alcohol consumption. After
              the psychedelic experience 83\% no longer met AUD criteria.
              Participants rated their psychedelic experience as highly
              meaningful and insightful, with 28\% endorsing
              psychedelic-associated changes in life priorities or values as
              facilitating reduced alcohol misuse. Greater psychedelic dose,
              insight, mystical-type effects, and personal meaning of
              experiences were associated with a greater reduction in alcohol
              consumption, controlling for prior alcohol consumption and

              demonstrate causality, they suggest that naturalistic psychedelic

              effects of systemic inflammatory events on central 5-HT function.
              Changes in blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast were
              detected in selected brain regions of anaesthetised rats in
              response to intravenous administration of the 5-HT-releasing
              agent, fenfluramine (10 mg/kg). Further groups of rats were
              pre-treated with the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0.5
              mg/kg), to induce systemic inflammation, or the selective 5-HT2A
              receptor antagonist MDL100907 prior to fenfluramine. The
              resultant phMRI data were investigated further through
              measurements of cortical 5-HT release (microdialysis), and
              vascular responsivity, as well as a more thorough investigation
              of the role of the 5-HT2A receptor in sickness behaviour.
              Fenfluramine evoked a positive BOLD response in the motor cortex
              (+15.9$\pm$2\%) and a negative BOLD response in the dorsal raphe
              nucleus (-9.9$\pm$4.2\%) and nucleus accumbens (-7.7$\pm$5.3\%).
              In all regions, BOLD responses to fenfluramine were significantly
              attenuated by pre-treatment with LPS (p<0.0001), but
              neurovascular coupling remained intact, and fenfluramine-evoked
              5-HT release was not affected. However, increased expression of
              the 5-HT2A receptor mRNA and decreased 5-HT2A-dependent behaviour
              (wet-dog shakes) was a feature of the LPS treatment and may
              underpin the altered phMRI signal. MDL100907 (0.5 mg/kg), 5-HT2A
              antagonist, significantly reduced the BOLD responses to
              fenfluramine in all three regions (p<0.0001) in a similar manner
              to LPS. Together these results suggest that systemic inflammation
              decreases brain 5-HT activity as assessed by phMRI. However,
              these effects do not appear to be mediated by changes in 5-HT
              release, but are associated with changes in
              5-HT2A-receptor-mediated downstream signalling pathways.",

              suggests a role for psilocybin to treat cancer-related anxiety
              and depression. METHODS: In this double-blind,
              placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 29 patients with
              cancer-related anxiety and depression were randomly assigned and
              received treatment with single-dose psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or
              niacin, both in conjunction with psychotherapy. The primary
              outcomes were anxiety and depression assessed between groups
              prior to the crossover at 7 weeks. RESULTS: Prior to the
              crossover, psilocybin produced immediate, substantial, and
              sustained improvements in anxiety and depression and led to
              decreases in cancer-related demoralization and hopelessness,
              improved spiritual wellbeing, and increased quality of life. At
              the 6.5-month follow-up, psilocybin was associated with enduring
              anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects (approximately 60-80\% of
              participants continued with clinically significant reductions in
              depression or anxiety), sustained benefits in existential
              distress and quality of life, as well as improved attitudes

              regulation of mood. Medications that block the neuronal 5-HT
              transporter (SERT) are used as major pharmacological treatment
              for mood disorders. Conversely, stimuli that enhance SERT
              activity might be predicted to diminish synaptic 5-HT
              availability and increase the risk for 5-HT-related CNS
              disorders. We have shown that the inflammatory cytokines enhance
              brain SERT activity in cultured serotonergic cells and nerve
              terminal preparations in vitro. In this study, we establish that
              intraperitoneal injection of the cytokine-inducer
              lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulates brain SERT activity, acting
              at doses below those required to induce overt motor suppression.
              SERT stimulation by LPS is paralleled by increased immobility in
              both the tail suspension test (TST) and the forced swim test
              (FST); antidepressant-sensitive alterations are thought to model
              aspects of behavioral despair. Both the stimulation of SERT
              activity and induced immobility are absent when LPS is
              administered to interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)-deficient mice and
              in the presence of SB203580, an inhibitor of IL-1R-stimulated p38
              MAPK. Moreover, the ability of LPS to enhance immobility in TST
              is lost in SERT knockout mice. These findings reveal an ability
              of peripheral inflammatory stimuli to enhance brain SERT activity
              through IL-1R and p38 MAPK pathways in vivo and identify a
              requirement for SERT expression in immune-system-modulated
              despair behaviors. Our studies identify IL-1R- and p38
              MAPK-dependent regulation of SERT as one of the mechanisms by
              which environmentally driven immune system activation can trigger
              despair-like behavior in an animal model, encouraging future

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Anecdotal reports suggest that psychedelic agents may
              relieve symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This
              modified double-blind study investigated the safety,
              tolerability, and clinical effects of psilocybin, a potent
              5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist, in patients with OCD. METHOD:
              Nine subjects with DSM-IV-defined OCD and no other current major
              psychiatric disorder participated in up to 4 single-dose
              exposures to psilocybin in doses ranging from sub-hallucinogenic
              to frankly hallucinogenic. Low (100 microg/kg), medium (200
              microg/kg), and high (300 microg/kg) doses were assigned in that
              order, and a very low dose (25 microg/kg) was inserted randomly
              and in double-blind fashion at any time after the first dose.
              Testing days were separated by at least 1 week. Each session was
              conducted over an 8-hour period in a controlled environment in an
              outpatient clinic; subjects were then transferred to a
              psychiatric inpatient unit for overnight observation. The
              Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) and a visual analog
              scale measuring overall obsessive-compulsive symptom severity
              were administered at 0, 4, 8, and 24 hours post-ingestion. The
              Hallucinogen Rating Scale was administered at 8 hours, and vital
              signs were recorded at 0, 1, 4, 8, and 24 hours after ingestion.
              The study was conducted from November 2001 to November 2004.
              RESULTS: Nine subjects were administered a total of 29 psilocybin
              doses. One subject experienced transient hypertension without
              relation to anxiety or somatic symptoms, but no other significant
              adverse effects were observed. Marked decreases in OCD symptoms
              of variable degrees were observed in all subjects during 1 or
              more of the testing sessions (23\%-100\% decrease in YBOCS
              score). Repeated-measures analysis of variance for all YBOCS
              values revealed a significant main effect of time on Wilks lambda
              (F = 9.86, df = 3,3; p = .046), but no significant effect of dose
              (F = 2.25, df = 3,3; p = .261) or interaction of time and dose (F
              = 0.923, df = 9,45; p = .515). Improvement generally lasted past
              the 24-hour timepoint. CONCLUSIONS: In a controlled clinical
              environment, psilocybin was safely used in subjects with OCD and
              was associated with acute reductions in core OCD symptoms in
              several subjects.",

              subjective effects requires human data. Previous human studies
              used varied groups of subjects and assessment methods. Rating
              scales for hallucinogen effects emphasized psychodynamic
              principles or the drugs' dysphoric properties. We describe the
              subjective effects of graded doses of N,N-dimethyltryptamine
              (DMT), an endogenous hallucinogen and drug of abuse, in a group
              of experienced hallucinogen users. We also present preliminary
              data from a new rating scale for these effects. METHODS: Twelve
              highly motivated volunteers received two doses (0.04 and 0.4
              mg/kg) of intravenous (IV) dimethyltryptamine fumarate
              ``nonblind,'' before entering a double-blind, saline
              placebo-controlled, randomized study using four doses of IV DMT.
              Subjects were carefully interviewed after resolution of drug
              effects, providing thorough and systematic descriptions of DMT's
              effects. They also were administered a new instrument, the
              Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS). The HRS was drafted from
              interviews obtained from an independent sample of 19 experienced
              DMT users, and modified during early stages of the study.
              RESULTS: Psychological effects of IV DMT began almost immediately
              after administration, peaked at 90 to 120 seconds, and were
              almost completely resolved by 30 minutes. This time course
              paralleled DMT blood levels previously described. Hallucinogenic
              effects were seen after 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg of dimethyltryptamine
              fumarate, and included a rapidly moving, brightly colored visual
              display of images. Auditory effects were less common. ``Loss of
              control,'' associated with a brief, but overwhelming ``rush,''
              led to a dissociated state, where euphoria alternated or
              coexisted with anxiety. These effects completely replaced
              subjects' previously ongoing mental experience and were more
              vivid and compelling than dreams or waking awareness. Lower
              doses, 0.1 and 0.05 mg/kg, were primarily affective and
              somaesthetic, while 0.1 mg/kg elicited the least desirable
              effects. Clustering of HRS items, using either a clinical, mental
              status method or principal components factor analysis provided
              better resolution of dose effects than did the biological
              variables described previously. CONCLUSIONS: These clinical and
              preliminary quantitative data provide bases for further
              psychopharmacologic characterization of DMT's properties in
              humans. They also may be used to compare the effects of other
              agents affecting relevant brain receptors in volunteer and

               of disease has been extended to include neuropsychiatric
               disorders including major depression. Patients with major
               depression have been found to exhibit increased peripheral blood
               inflammatory biomarkers, including inflammatory cytokines, which
               have been shown to access the brain and interact with virtually

               depression, including neurotransmitter metabolism,
               neuroendocrine function, and neural plasticity. Indeed,
               activation of inflammatory pathways within the brain is believed
               to contribute to a confluence of decreased neurotrophic support
               and altered glutamate release/reuptake, as well as oxidative
               stress, leading to excitotoxicity and loss of glial elements,
               consistent with neuropathologic findings that characterize
               depressive disorders. Further instantiating the link between
               inflammation and depression are data demonstrating that
               psychosocial stress, a well-known precipitant of mood disorders,
               is capable of stimulating inflammatory signaling molecules,
               including nuclear factor kappa B, in part, through activation of
               sympathetic nervous system outflow pathways. Interestingly,
               depressed patients with increased inflammatory biomarkers have
               been found to be more likely to exhibit treatment resistance,
               and in several studies, antidepressant therapy has been
               associated with decreased inflammatory responses. Finally,
               preliminary data from patients with inflammatory disorders, as
               well as medically healthy depressed patients, suggest that
               inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines or their signaling pathways
               may improve depressed mood and increase treatment response to
               conventional antidepressant medication. Translational
               implications of these findings include the unique opportunity to
               identify relevant patient populations, apply immune-targeted
               therapies, and monitor therapeutic efficacy at the level of the

              numerous cognitive processes. They are generally considered
              physiologically safe and do not lead to dependence or addiction.
              Their origin predates written history, and they were employed by
              early cultures in many sociocultural and ritual contexts. After
              the virtually contemporaneous discovery of (5R,8R)-(+)-lysergic
              acid-N,N-diethylamide (LSD)-25 and the identification of
              serotonin in the brain, early research focused intensively on the
              possibility that LSD and other psychedelics had a serotonergic
              basis for their action. Today there is a consensus that
              psychedelics are agonists or partial agonists at brain serotonin
              5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors, with particular importance on
              those expressed on apical dendrites of neocortical pyramidal
              cells in layer V. Several useful rodent models have been
              developed over the years to help unravel the neurochemical
              correlates of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor
              activation in the brain, and a variety of imaging techniques have
              been employed to identify key brain areas that are directly
              affected by psychedelics. Recent and exciting developments in the
              field have occurred in clinical research, where several

              psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy also have shown positive
              benefit in treating both alcohol and nicotine addiction.
              Recently, blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic
              resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography have been employed
              for in vivo brain imaging in humans after administration of a

              global societal burden, especially in patients already suffering
              from chronic diseases. These symptoms have been identified by
              those affected as some of the most disabling symptoms which
              affect the quality of life and productivity of the individual.
              While many factors play a role in the development of depression
              and fatigue, both have been associated with increased
              inflammatory activation of the immune system affecting both the
              periphery and the central nervous system (CNS). This is further
              supported by the well-described association between diseases that
              involve immune activation and these symptoms in autoimmune
              disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and immune system
              activation in response to infections, like sepsis. Treatments for
              depression also support this immunopsychiatric link.
              Antidepressants have been shown to decrease inflammation, while
              higher levels of baseline inflammation predict lower treatment
              efficacy for most treatments. Those patients with higher initial
              immune activation may on the other hand be more responsive to

              immune system which may serve as a valid target for treatment.

              nuclear factor (NF)-kB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were
              compared in medically healthy male subjects with current major

              nondepressed male comparison subjects (N=14) before and after

              Stress Test-induced increases in IL-6 and NF-kappaB DNA-binding
              were greater in major depression patients with increased early
              life stress and independently correlated with depression

              systems that encode causal structure in the sensorium. Perception
              is equated with the optimization or inversion of these internal
              models, to explain sensory data. Given a model of how sensory
              data are generated, we can invoke a generic approach to model
              inversion, based on a free energy bound on the model's evidence.
              The ensuing free-energy formulation furnishes equations that
              prescribe the process of recognition, i.e. the dynamics of
              neuronal activity that represent the causes of sensory input.
              Here, we focus on a very general model, whose hierarchical and

              administrations of psilocybin with psychological support produces
              antidepressant effects in patients with cancer and in those with
              treatment-resistant depression. Objective: To investigate the
              effect of psilocybin therapy in patients with MDD. Design,
              Setting, and Participants: This randomized, waiting
              list-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Center for
              Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins Bayview
              Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. Adults aged 21 to 75 years
              with an MDD diagnosis, not currently using antidepressant
              medications, and without histories of psychotic disorder, serious
              suicide attempt, or hospitalization were eligible to participate.
              Enrollment occurred between August 2017 and April 2019, and the
              4-week primary outcome assessments were completed in July 2019. A
              total of 27 participants were randomized to an immediate
              treatment condition group (n = 15) or delayed treatment condition
              group (waiting list control condition; n = 12). Data analysis was
              conducted from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, and included
              participants who completed the intervention (evaluable
              population). Interventions: Two psilocybin sessions (session 1:
              20 mg/70 kg; session 2: 30 mg/70 kg) were given (administered in
              opaque gelatin capsules with approximately 100 mL of water) in
              the context of supportive psychotherapy (approximately 11 hours).
              Participants were randomized to begin treatment immediately or
              after an 8-week delay. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary
              outcome, depression severity was assessed with the GRID-Hamilton
              Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD) scores at baseline (score of
              $\geq$17 required for enrollment) and weeks 5 and 8 after
              enrollment for the delayed treatment group, which corresponded to
              weeks 1 and 4 after the intervention for the immediate treatment
              group. Secondary outcomes included the Quick Inventory of
              Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated (QIDS-SR). Results: Of the
              randomized participants, 24 of 27 (89\%) completed the
              intervention and the week 1 and week 4 postsession assessments.
              This population had a mean (SD) age of 39.8 (12.2) years, was
              composed of 16 women (67\%), and had a mean (SD) baseline
              GRID-HAMD score of 22.8 (3.9). The mean (SD) GRID-HAMD scores at
              weeks 1 and 4 (8.0 [7.1] and 8.5 [5.7]) in the immediate
              treatment group were statistically significantly lower than the
              scores at the comparable time points of weeks 5 and 8 (23.8 [5.4]
              and 23.5 [6.0]) in the delayed treatment group. The effect sizes
              were large at week 5 (Cohen d = 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.4-3.0; P < .001)
              and week 8 (Cohen d = 2.6; 95\% CI, 1.7-3.6; P < .001). The
              QIDS-SR documented a rapid decrease in mean (SD) depression score
              from baseline to day 1 after session 1 (16.7 [3.5] vs 6.3 [4.4];
              Cohen d = 3.0; 95\% CI, 1.9-4.0; P < .001), which remained
              statistically significantly reduced through the week 4 follow-up
              (6.0 [5.7]; Cohen d = 3.1; 95\% CI, 1.9-4.2; P < .001). In the
              overall sample, 16 participants (67\%) at week 1 and 17 (71\%) at
              week 4 had a clinically significant response to the intervention
              ($\geq$50\% reduction in GRID-HAMD score), and 14 participants
              (58\%) at week 1 and 13 participants (54\%) at week 4 were in
              remission ($\leq$7 GRID-HAMD score). Conclusions and Relevance:
              Findings suggest that psilocybin with therapy is efficacious in
              treating MDD, thus extending the results of previous studies of
              this intervention in patients with cancer and depression and of a
              nonrandomized study in patients with treatment-resistant
              depression. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

              cognitive processes. It is densely innervated by serotonergic
              neurons originating from the dorsal and median raphe nuclei,
              which profoundly influence PFC activity. Among the 5-HT receptors
              abundantly expressed in PFC, 5-HT2A receptors located in
              dendrites of layer V pyramidal neurons control neuronal
              excitability and mediate the psychotropic effects of psychedelic
              hallucinogens, but their impact on glutamatergic transmission and
              synaptic plasticity remains poorly characterized. Here, we show
              that a 20-min exposure of mouse PFC slices to serotonin or the
              5-HT2A receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI)

              relation between biased cognitive processing and the
              dysregulation of emotion in depression: inhibitory processes and
              deficits in working memory, ruminative responses to negative mood

              positive and rewarding stimuli to regulate negative mood. In this

              stress. Decreased levels of BDNF, as well as other neurotrophic
              factors, could contribute to the atrophy of certain limbic
              structures, including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex that
              has been observed in depressed subjects. Conversely, the
              neurotrophic actions of antidepressants could reverse neuronal
              atrophy and cell loss and thereby contribute to the therapeutic
              actions of these treatments. This review provides a critical
              examination of the neurotrophic hypothesis of depression that has
              evolved from this work, including analysis of preclinical
              cellular (adult neurogenesis) and behavioral models of depression
              and antidepressant actions, as well as clinical neuroimaging and
              postmortem studies. Although there are some limitations, the
              results of these studies are consistent with the hypothesis that
              decreased expression of BDNF and possibly other growth factors
              contributes to depression and that upregulation of BDNF plays a
              role in the actions of antidepressant treatment.",

              frequently prescribed antidepressant drugs, because they are well
              tolerated and have no severe side effects. They rapidly block
              serotonin (5-HT) reuptake, yet the onset of their therapeutic
              action requires weeks of treatment. This delay is the result of
              presynaptic and postsynaptic adaptive mechanisms secondary to
              reuptake inhibition. The prevention of a negative feedback
              mechanism operating at the 5-HT autoreceptor level enhances the
              neurochemical and clinical effects of SSRIs. The blockade of
              5-HT2A receptors also seems to improve the clinical effects of
              SSRIs. These receptors are located postsynaptically to 5-HT
              axons, mainly in the neocortex. Pyramidal neurons in the
              prefrontal cortex are particularly enriched in 5-HT2A receptors.
              Their blockade may affect the function of prefrontal-subcortical
              circuits, an effect that probably underlies the beneficial
              effects of the addition of atypical antipsychotic drugs, which
              are 5-HT2A receptor antagonists, to SSRIs in treatment-resistant

              direct comparisons between psilocybin and established treatments
              for depression are lacking. METHODS: In a phase 2, double-blind,
              randomized, controlled trial involving patients with
              long-standing, moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, we
              compared psilocybin with escitalopram, a selective
              serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, over a 6-week period. Patients were
              assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two separate doses of 25 mg of
              psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily placebo
              (psilocybin group) or two separate doses of 1 mg of psilocybin 3
              weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily oral escitalopram (escitalopram
              group); all the patients received psychological support. The
              primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the
              16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report
              (QIDS-SR-16; scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores
              indicating greater depression) at week 6. There were 16 secondary
              outcomes, including QIDS-SR-16 response (defined as a reduction
              in score of >50\%) and QIDS-SR-16 remission (defined as a score
              of $\leq$5) at week 6. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were
              enrolled; 30 were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 to the
              escitalopram group. The mean scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at baseline
              were 14.5 in the psilocybin group and 16.4 in the escitalopram
              group. The mean ($\pm$SE) changes in the scores from baseline to
              week 6 were -8.0$\pm$1.0 points in the psilocybin group and
              -6.0$\pm$1.0 in the escitalopram group, for a between-group
              difference of 2.0 points (95\% confidence interval [CI], -5.0 to
              0.9) (P = 0.17). A QIDS-SR-16 response occurred in 70\% of the
              patients in the psilocybin group and in 48\% of those in the
              escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 22
              percentage points (95\% CI, -3 to 48); QIDS-SR-16 remission
              occurred in 57\% and 28\%, respectively, for a between-group
              difference of 28 percentage points (95\% CI, 2 to 54). Other
              secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over
              escitalopram, but the analyses were not corrected for multiple
              comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the
              trial groups. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the change in
              depression scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at week 6, this trial did not
              show a significant difference in antidepressant effects between
              psilocybin and escitalopram in a selected group of patients.
              Secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over
              escitalopram, but the analyses of these outcomes lacked
              correction for multiple comparisons. Larger and longer trials are
              required to compare psilocybin with established antidepressants.

              psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation pilot study between 2009
              and 2015. AIMS: The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to
              identify perceived mechanisms of change leading to smoking
              cessation in the pilot study; (2) to identify key themes in
              participant experiences and long-term outcomes to better
              understand the therapeutic process. METHODS: Participants were
              invited to a retrospective follow-up interview an average of 30
              months after initial psilocybin sessions. Semi-structured
              interviews were conducted with 12 of the 15 participants. Data
              were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants
              reported gaining vivid insights into self-identity and reasons
              for smoking from their psilocybin sessions. Experiences of
              interconnectedness, awe, and curiosity persisted beyond the
              duration of acute drug effects. Participants emphasised that the
              content of psilocybin experiences overshadowed any short-term
              withdrawal symptoms. Preparatory counselling, strong rapport with
              the study team, and a sense of momentum once engaged in the study
              treatment were perceived as vital additional factors in achieving
              abstinence. In addition, participants reported a range of
              persisting positive changes beyond smoking cessation, including
              increased aesthetic appreciation, altruism, and pro-social
              behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the value of
              qualitative research in the psychopharmacological investigation
              of psychedelics. They describe perceived connections between
              drug- and non-drug factors, and provide suggestions for future

              has been found in quantitative genetic studies investigating
              healthy individuals suggesting that at least part of this
              variance is due to genetic factors. Since the HPA axis is
              regulated by a neuronal network including amygdala, hippocampus,
              prefrontal cortex as well as brainstem circuits, the
              investigation of candidate genes that impact neurotransmitter
              systems related to these brain regions might further elucidate
              the genetic underpinnings of the stress response. However, aside
              from genetic risk factors, past stressful life events might also
              result in long-term adjustments of HPA axis reactivity. Here, we
              investigated the effects of the -1019 G/C polymorphism in the

              between past stressful life events and cortisol release but no

               patients generally display co-morbid symptoms, and depression
               frequently accompanies other serious disorders. Currently
               available drugs display limited efficacy and a pronounced delay
               to onset of action, and all provoke distressing side effects.
               Cloning of the human genome has fuelled expectations that
               symptomatic treatment may soon become more rapid and effective,
               and that depressive states may ultimately be ``prevented'' or
               ``cured''. In pursuing these objectives, in particular for
               genome-derived, non-monoaminergic targets, ``specificity'' of
               drug actions is often emphasized. That is, priority is afforded
               to agents that interact exclusively with a single site
               hypothesized as critically involved in the pathogenesis and/or
               control of depression. Certain highly selective drugs may prove
               effective, and they remain indispensable in the experimental
               (and clinical) evaluation of the significance of novel
               mechanisms. However, by analogy to other multifactorial
               disorders, ``multi-target'' agents may be better adapted to the
               improved treatment of depressive states. Support for this
               contention is garnered from a broad palette of observations,
               ranging from mechanisms of action of adjunctive drug
               combinations and electroconvulsive therapy to ``network theory''
               analysis of the etiology and management of depressive states.
               The review also outlines opportunities to be exploited, and
               challenges to be addressed, in the discovery and
               characterization of drugs recognizing multiple targets. Finally,
               a diversity of multi-target strategies is proposed for the more
               efficacious and rapid control of core and co-morbid symptoms of
               depression, together with improved tolerance relative to
               currently available agents.",

              with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up.
              Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy

              participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout the study.
              High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and
              self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with
              increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and

              are a unique family of polypeptide growth factors that influence
              differentiation and survival of neurons in the developing nervous
              system. In adults, BDNF is important in regulating synaptic

               functional synaptic plasticity, and the molecular and cellular

              cytokines between MDD patients and controls. We pooled the effect
              sizes for standardized mean differences (SMD) of the levels of
              sIL-2R and cytokines. We also performed meta-regression and
              sensitivity analyses to investigate the roles of age, gender,
              sample type, ethnic origin and selected studies' quality in
              explaining potential heterogeneity and differences in results
              respectively. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were selected for this
              analysis. The levels of sIL-2R, TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-6 in MDD
              patients were significantly higher than those of healthy controls
              (SMD=0.555, p<0.001, SMD=0.567, p=0.010; SMD=0.680, p<0.001).
              Mean age of all subjects was a significant moderator to explain
              the high heterogeneity of IL-6. Sensitivity analysis found that
              European but not non-European subjects have higher levels
              difference of sIL-2R, TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-1$\beta$ between MDD
              patients and controls. LIMITATION: The severity of MDD was not
              considered. CONCLUSION: The blood levels of sIL-2R, TNF-$\alpha$
              and IL-6 were significantly higher in MDD patients than controls.
              Age, samples source and ethnic origins may play a potential role
              in heterogeneity.",

               to explain the insidious relationship between rumination and
               depression. We review the aspects of the response styles theory
               that have been well-supported, including evidence that
               rumination exacerbates depression, enhances negative thinking,
               impairs problem solving, interferes with instrumental behavior,
               and erodes social support. Next, we address contradictory and
               new findings. Specifically, rumination appears to more
               consistently predict the onset of depression rather than the
               duration, but rumination interacts with negative cognitive
               styles to predict the duration of depressive symptoms. Contrary
               to original predictions, the use of positive distractions has
               not consistently been correlated with lower levels of depressive
               symptoms in correlational studies, although dozens of
               experimental studies show positive distractions relieve
               depressed mood. Further, evidence now suggests that rumination
               is associated with psychopathologies in addition to depression,
               including anxiety, binge eating, binge drinking, and self-harm.
               We discuss the relationships between rumination and worry and
               between rumination and other coping or emotion-regulation
               strategies. Finally, we highlight recent research on the
               distinction between rumination and more adaptive forms of
               self-reflection, on basic cognitive deficits or biases in
               rumination, on its neural and genetic correlates, and on
               possible interventions to combat rumination.",

              has been associated with development and maintenance of major
              depressive disorder (MDD). The emotional Stroop task assesses
              interference effects arising from the conflict of emotional
              expressions consistent with disorder-specific self-schemata and
              cognitive colour-naming instructions. Functional neuroimaging
              studies of the emotional Stroop effect advocate a critical
              involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during these
              processes. METHOD: Subjects were 17 medication-free individuals
              with unipolar MDD in an acute depressive episode (mean age 39
              years), and 17 age-, gender- and IQ-matched healthy volunteers.
              In an emotional Stroop task, sad and neutral words were presented
              in various colours, and subjects were required to name the colour
              of words whilst undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging
              (fMRI). Overt verbal responses were acquired with a clustered
              fMRI acquisition sequence. RESULTS: Individuals with depression
              showed greater increases in response time from neutral to sad
              words relative to controls. fMRI data showed a significant
              engagement of left rostral ACC (BA 32) and right precuneus during
              sad words in patients relative to controls. Additionally, rostral
              ACC activation was positively correlated with latencies of
              negative words in MDD patients. Healthy controls did not have any
              regions of increased activation compared to MDD patients.
              CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence for a behavioural
              and neural emotional Stroop effect in MDD and highlight the
              importance of the ACC during monitoring of conflicting cognitive
              processes and mood-congruent processing in depression.",

  abstract = "The cognitive model of depression has significantly influenced
              the understanding of distorted cognitive processes in major
              depression; however, this model's conception of cognition has
              recently been criticized as possibly too broad and unspecific. In
              this review, we connect insights from cognitive neuroscience and
              psychiatry to suggest that the traditional cognitive model may
              benefit from a reformulation that takes current Bayesian models
              of the brain into account. Appealing to a predictive processing
              account, we explain that healthy human learning is normally based
              on making predictions and experiencing discrepancies between
              predicted and actual events or experiences. We present evidence
              suggesting that this learning mechanism is distorted in
              depression: current research indicates that people with
              depression tend to negatively reappraise or disregard positive
              information that disconfirms negative expectations, thus
              resulting in sustained negative predictions and biased learning.
              We also review the neurophysiological correlates of such deficits
              in processing prediction errors in people with depression.
              Synthesizing these findings, we propose a novel mechanistic model
              of depression suggesting that people with depression have the
              tendency to predominantly expect negative events or experiences,
              which they subjectively feel confirmed due to reappraisal of
              disconfirming evidence, thus creating a self-reinforcing negative
              feedback loop. Computationally, we consider too much precision
              afforded to negative prior beliefs as the main candidate of
              pathology, accompanied by an attenuation of positive prediction
              errors. We conclude by outlining some directions for future
              research into the understanding of the behavioral and
              neurophysiological underpinnings of this model and point to
              clinical implications of it.",

              antidepressants are more efficacious than placebo for adult
              depression was supported by the evidence. DESIGN: Reanalysis of a
              systematic review, with meta-analyses. DATA SOURCES: 522 trials
              (116 477 participants) as reported in the systematic review by
              Cipriani et al and clinical study reports for 19 of these trials.
              ANALYSIS: We used the Cochrane Handbook's risk of bias tool and
              the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and
              Evaluation (GRADE) approach to evaluate the risk of bias and the
              certainty of evidence, respectively. The impact of several study
              characteristics and publication status was estimated using
              pairwise subgroup meta-analyses. RESULTS: Several methodological
              limitations in the evidence base of antidepressants were either
              unrecognised or underestimated in the systematic review by
              Cipriani et al. The effect size for antidepressants versus
              placebo on investigator-rated depression symptom scales was
              higher in trials with a 'placebo run-in' study design compared
              with trials without a placebo run-in design (p=0.05). The effect
              size of antidepressants was higher in published trials compared
              with unpublished trials (p<0.0001). The outcome data reported by
              Cipriani et al differed from the clinical study reports in 12
              (63\%) of 19 trials. The certainty of the evidence for the
              placebo-controlled comparisons should be very low according to
              GRADE due to a high risk of bias, indirectness of the evidence
              and publication bias. The mean difference between antidepressants
              and placebo on the 17-item Hamilton depression rating scale
              (range 0-52 points) was 1.97 points (95\% CI 1.74 to 2.21).
              CONCLUSIONS: The evidence does not support definitive conclusions
              regarding the benefits of antidepressants for depression in
              adults. It is unclear whether antidepressants are more
              efficacious than placebo.",

              to depression and the anxiety disorders. It remains unclear
              whether these effects are a consequence of the amelioration of
              the causal processes that generate risk or the introduction of
              compensatory strategies that offset them and whether these

               appreciably since its first formulation over 40 years ago, the
               potential interaction of genetic, neurochemical, and cognitive
               factors has only recently been demonstrated. Combining findings
               from behavioral genetics and cognitive neuroscience with the
               accumulated research on the cognitive model opens new
               opportunities for integrated research. Drawing on advances in
               cognitive, personality, and social psychology as well as
               clinical observations, expansions of the original cognitive
               model have incorporated in successive stages automatic thoughts,
               cognitive distortions, dysfunctional beliefs, and
               information-processing biases. The developmental model
               identified early traumatic experiences and the formation of
               dysfunctional beliefs as predisposing events and congruent
               stressors in later life as precipitating factors. It is now
               possible to sketch out possible genetic and neurochemical
               pathways that interact with or are parallel to cognitive
               variables. A hypersensitive amygdala is associated with both a
               genetic polymorphism and a pattern of negative cognitive biases
               and dysfunctional beliefs, all of which constitute risk factors
               for depression. Further, the combination of a hyperactive
               amygdala and hypoactive prefrontal regions is associated with
               diminished cognitive appraisal and the occurrence of depression.
               Genetic polymorphisms also are involved in the overreaction to
               the stress and the hypercortisolemia in the development of
               depression--probably mediated by cognitive distortions. I
               suggest that comprehensive study of the psychological as well as

              likely that alterations in several interacting systems underlie
              its pathogenesis. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to
              elucidate its origins. The inflammatory hypothesis emphasises the
              role of psycho-neuroimmunological dysfunctions. This is based on
              several observations: subsets of MDD patients have an altered
              peripheral immune system, with impaired cellular immunity and
              increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines; cytokines can

               Clinical Evidence and Potential Therapeutic Mechanisms in
               Substance Use and Mood Disorders",

  abstract  = "Classical psychedelics, primarily psilocybin and lysergic acid
               diethylamide (LSD), have been used and extensively studied in
               Western medicine as part of substance-assisted psychotherapy in
               the 1950s and 1960s. Modern clinical research is currently
               gaining momentum and provides new evidence for the safety and
               efficacy of classical psychedelics (primarily psilocybin, but
               also LSD and ayahuasca) in the treatment of different
               psychiatric conditions, including substance use and mood
               disorders. In this review article, we outline common
               pathological mechanisms of substance use disorders (SUD) and
               unipolar depression. Next, the current literature on the effects
               of psychedelics is summarized in order to generate hypotheses
               regarding their potential therapeutic mechanisms of action in
               treating these psychiatric conditions. Finally, we review and
               discuss clinical trials published since 2011 investigating the
               effects of psychedelics in SUD and depression. While results
               from those modern clinical trials are promising, most of them do
               not meet the methodological requirements to allow firm
               conclusions on the clinical efficacy of psychedelics. Larger,
               blinded, randomized controlled trials (RCT) with clearly defined
               patient groups and well-defined primary endpoints are needed.
               Additionally, the therapeutic mechanisms of classical
               psychedelics are currently unknown. This review presents
               hypotheses derived from preclinical and human studies that need
               to be tested in future trials to better understand the clinical
               potential of psychedelic substances in modern psychiatry.",

              evaluate the effects of a single dose of AYA in six volunteers
              with a current depressive episode. METHODS: Open-label trial
              conducted in an inpatient psychiatric unit. RESULTS:
              Statistically significant reductions of up to 82\% in depressive
              scores were observed between baseline and 1, 7, and 21 days after
              AYA administration, as measured on the Hamilton Rating Scale for
              Depression (HAM-D), the Montgomery-{\AA}sberg Depression Rating
              Scale (MADRS), and the Anxious-Depression subscale of the Brief
              Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). AYA administration resulted in
              nonsignificant changes in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores
              and in the thinking disorder subscale of the BPRS, suggesting
              that AYA does not induce episodes of mania and/or hypomania in
              patients with mood disorders and that modifications in thought
              content, which could indicate psychedelic effects, are not
              essential for mood improvement. CONCLUSIONS: These results
              suggest that AYA has fast-acting anxiolytic and antidepressant

              The ability to promote both structural and functional plasticity
              in the PFC has been hypothesized to underlie the fast-acting
              antidepressant properties of the dissociative anesthetic
              ketamine. Here, we report that, like ketamine, serotonergic
              psychedelics are capable of robustly increasing neuritogenesis
              and/or spinogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. These changes in
              neuronal structure are accompanied by increased synapse number
              and function, as measured by fluorescence microscopy and
              electrophysiology. The structural changes induced by psychedelics
              appear to result from stimulation of the TrkB, mTOR, and 5-HT2A
              signaling pathways and could possibly explain the clinical
              effectiveness of these compounds. Our results underscore the
              therapeutic potential of psychedelics and, importantly, identify
              several lead scaffolds for medicinal chemistry efforts focused on
              developing plasticity-promoting compounds as safe, effective, and

Modes of data collection by questionnaire differ in several ways, including the method of contacting respondents, the medium of delivering the questionnaire to respondents, and the administration of the questions. These are likely to have different effects on the quality of the data collected.Methods This paper is based on a narrative review of systematic and non-systematic searches of the literature on the effects of mode of questionnaire administration on data quality.Results Within different modes of questionnaire administration, there were many documented potential, biasing influences on the responses obtained. These were greatest between different types of mode (e.g. self-administered versus interview modes), rather than within modes. It can be difficult to separate out the effects of the different influences, at different levels.Conclusions The biasing effects of mode of questionnaire administration has important implications for research methodology, the validity of the results of research, and for the soundness of public policy developed from evidence using questionnaire-based research. All users of questionnaires need to be aware of these potential effects on their data.}",

abstract = {Depression is a significant public health problem but symptom remission is difficult to predict. This may be due to substantial heterogeneity underlying the disorder. Latent class analysis (LCA) is often used to elucidate clinically relevant depression subtypes but whether or not consistent subtypes emerge is unclear. We sought to critically examine the implementation and reporting of LCA in this context by performing a systematic review to identify articles detailing the use of LCA to explore subtypes of depression among samples of adults endorsing depression symptoms. PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched to identify eligible articles indexed prior to January 2016. Twenty-four articles reporting 28 LCA models were eligible for inclusion. Sample characteristics varied widely. The majority of articles used depression symptoms as the observed indicators of the latent depression subtypes. Details regarding model fit and selection were often lacking. No consistent set of depression subtypes was identified across studies. Differences in how models were constructed might partially explain the conflicting results. Standards for using, interpreting, and reporting LCA models could improve our understanding of the LCA results. Incorporating dimensions of depression other than symptoms, such as functioning, may be helpful in determining depression subtypes.}

Consecutive patients visiting a site during the study were screened and stratified on the basis of DSM-IV diagnoses or symptomatic presentations. Patients were randomly assigned to two clinicians for a diagnostic interview; clinicians were blind to any previous diagnosis. All data were entered directly via an Internet-based software system to a secure central server. Detailed research design and statistical methods are presented in an accompanying article.ResultsThere were a total of 15 adult and eight child/adolescent diagnoses for which adequate sample sizes were obtained to report adequately precise estimates of the intraclass kappa. Overall, five diagnoses were in the very good range (kappa=0.60–0.79), nine in the good range (kappa=0.40–0.59), six in the questionable range (kappa=0.20–0.39), and three in the unacceptable range (kappa values <0.20). Eight diagnoses had insufficient sample sizes to generate precise kappa estimates at any site.ConclusionsMost diagnoses adequately tested had good to very good reliability with these representative clinical populations assessed with usual clinical interview methods. Some diagnoses that were revised to encompass a broader spectrum of symptom expression or had a more dimensional approach tested in the good to very good range. }

              indicate a rise in administrative prevalence of depression, while
              population surveys with standardized diagnostic procedures do
              not. We describe recent trends in the prevalence of depressive
              disorders as diagnosed in routine care from 2009-2017 in Germany.
              METHODS: We used nationwide ambulatory claims data from all
              residents with statutory health insurance, covering 87\% of the
              total population. Cases were defined as persons with at least one
              documented diagnosis of depression (ICD-10-GM codes: F32, F33 or
              F34.1). The administrative prevalence was computed for each year
              according to age, sex, degree of urbanization and severity of
              depression diagnosis. RESULTS: The prevalence increased from
              12.5\% in 2009 to 15.7\% in 2017 (+26\%). Overall, women were
              twice as likely as men to receive a diagnosis, although the
              prevalence increased more strongly in men compared to women
              (+40\% vs. +20\%). Age- and sex-stratified analyses revealed the
              highest prevalence increase in adolescents and young men at the
              ages of 15-19 years (+95\%) and 20-25 years (+72\%). Rural areas
              with a low population density showed the highest rise in
              administrative prevalence (+34\%), while big urban municipalities
              showed the lowest (+25\%). LIMITATIONS: Administrative claims
              data rely on diagnoses coded for billing purposes and thus depend
              on coding practice as well as patients' help seeking behavior.
              CONCLUSIONS: Depressive disorders are of increasing importance in
              ambulatory health care in Germany. Parts of the increase may be
              attributed to changing cultural constructions of mental health

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence of depression,
              information about the burden of this disease in Switzerland is
              scarce. A better knowledge of the costs of depression may provide
              important information for future national preventive programmes,
              optimizing cost-effective budgeting. The estimates of national
              costs may improve the public's awareness of depression and
              depression-related costs, breaking down the taboo of depression
              as an illness. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to analyse
              the annual cost for different levels of depression and to
              investigate the annual economic burden of depression in
              Switzerland. METHODS: A retrospective, multicentre,
              non-interventional study in psychiatrist practices was carried
              out. Outpatients who had been diagnosed with depression in the
              last 3 years were included. Patient demographics and information
              on clinical characteristics and resource utilization in the first
              12 months after diagnosis were collected. Costs analysis,
              subdivided into direct and indirect costs, was performed for
              three depression severity classes (mild, moderate and severe),
              according to the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
              (HDRS-17). Costs were also extrapolated to a national level.
              Regression analysis was performed to control for factors that may
              have an impact on the cost of depression. RESULTS: A total of 556
              patients were included. Hospitalization and hospitalization days
              were directly correlated with disease severity (p 3,561 for mild,
              9,744 for moderate and 16,240 for severe depression. The mean
              indirect costs per person per year, mainly due to workdays lost,
              were 8,730 for mild, 12,675 for moderate and 16,669 for severe
              depression (year 2007/2008 values). Regression analysis showed
              that hospitalization days, psychiatrist visits in hospital,
              disability insurance, workdays lost and the HDRS-17 score were
              significantly correlated to the total costs. Extrapolation at a
              national level resulted in a total burden of about 8.1-8.3
              billion per year. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of depression in
              Switzerland was estimated to be about 8 billion per year. The
              costs of depression were directly related to disease severity.
              However, since many cases of depression remain unreported and
              since this analysis only included individuals between 18 and 65
              years of age, it is reasonable to suppose that the total burden
              of depression may be even higher.",

              States--including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar
              disorder, and dysthymia--was estimated at \$83.1 billion in 2000.
              We update these findings using recent data, focusing on MDD alone
              and accounting for comorbid physical and psychiatric disorders.
              METHOD: Using national survey (DSM-IV criteria) and
              administrative claims data (ICD-9 codes), we estimate the
              incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD as well as
              the share of these costs attributable to MDD, with attention to
              any changes that occurred between 2005 and 2010. RESULTS: The
              incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD increased by
              21.5\% (from \$173.2 billion to \$210.5 billion,
              inflation-adjusted dollars). The composition of these costs
              remained stable, with approximately 45\% attributable to direct
              costs, 5\% to suicide-related costs, and 50\% to workplace costs.
              Only 38\% of the total costs were due to MDD itself as opposed to
              comorbid conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid conditions account for
              the largest portion of the growing economic burden of MDD. Future
              research should analyze further these comorbidities as well as
              the relative importance of factors contributing to that growing
              burden. These include population growth, increase in MDD
              prevalence, increase in treatment cost per individual with MDD,
              changes in employment and treatment rates, as well as changes in

              phobia. More than half of all lifetime disorders occurred in the
              14\% of the population who had a history of three or more
              comorbid disorders. These highly comorbid people also included
              the vast majority of people with severe disorders. Less than 40\%
              of those with a lifetime disorder had ever received professional
              treatment, and less than 20\% of those with a recent disorder had
              been in treatment during the past 12 months. Consistent with
              previous risk factor research, it was found that women had
              elevated rates of affective disorders and anxiety disorders, that
              men had elevated rates of substance use disorders and antisocial
              personality disorder, and that most disorders declined with age
              and with higher socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence
              of psychiatric disorders is greater than previously thought to be
              the case. Furthermore, this morbidity is more highly concentrated
              than previously recognized in roughly one sixth of the population
              who have a history of three or more comorbid disorders. This
              suggests that the causes and consequences of high comorbidity
              should be the focus of research attention. The majority of people
              with psychiatric disorders fail to obtain professional treatment.
              Even among people with a lifetime history of three or more
              comorbid disorders, the proportion who ever obtain specialty
              sector mental health treatment is less than 50\%. These results
              argue for the importance of more outreach and more research on
              barriers to professional help-seeking.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases,
              Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010) to estimate the
              burden of disease attributable to mental and substance use
              disorders in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs),
              years of life lost to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived
              with disability (YLDs). METHODS: For each of the 20 mental and
              substance use disorders included in GBD 2010, we systematically
              reviewed epidemiological data and used a Bayesian meta-regression
              tool, DisMod-MR, to model prevalence by age, sex, country,
              region, and year. We obtained disability weights from
              representative community surveys and an internet-based survey to
              calculate YLDs. We calculated premature mortality as YLLs from
              cause of death estimates for 1980-2010 for 20 age groups, both
              sexes, and 187 countries. We derived DALYs from the sum of YLDs
              and YLLs. We adjusted burden estimates for comorbidity and
              present them with 95\% uncertainty intervals. FINDINGS: In 2010,
              mental and substance use disorders accounted for 183·9 million
              DALYs (95\% UI 153·5 million-216·7 million), or 7·4\% (6·2-8·6)
              of all DALYs worldwide. Such disorders accounted for 8·6 million
              YLLs (6·5 million-12·1 million; 0·5\% [0·4-0·7] of all YLLs) and
              175·3 million YLDs (144·5 million-207·8 million; 22·9\%
              [18·6-27·2] of all YLDs). Mental and substance use disorders were
              the leading cause of YLDs worldwide. Depressive disorders
              accounted for 40·5\% (31·7-49·2) of DALYs caused by mental and
              substance use disorders, with anxiety disorders accounting for
              14·6\% (11·2-18·4), illicit drug use disorders for 10·9\%
              (8·9-13·2), alcohol use disorders for 9·6\% (7·7-11·8),
              schizophrenia for 7·4\% (5·0-9·8), bipolar disorder for 7·0\%
              (4·4-10·3), pervasive developmental disorders for 4·2\%
              (3·2-5·3), childhood behavioural disorders for 3·4\% (2·2-4·7),
              and eating disorders for 1·2\% (0·9-1·5). DALYs varied by age and
              sex, with the highest proportion of total DALYs occurring in
              people aged 10-29 years. The burden of mental and substance use
              disorders increased by 37·6\% between 1990 and 2010, which for
              most disorders was driven by population growth and ageing.
              INTERPRETATION: Despite the apparently small contribution of
              YLLs--with deaths in people with mental disorders coded to the
              physical cause of death and suicide coded to the category of
              injuries under self-harm--our findings show the striking and
              growing challenge that these disorders pose for health systems in
              developed and developing regions. In view of the magnitude of
              their contribution, improvement in population health is only
              possible if countries make the prevention and treatment of mental
              and substance use disorders a public health priority. FUNDING:

              excess mortality among people with mental disorders, no
              comprehensive meta-analyses have been conducted quantifying
              mortality across mental disorders. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a
              systematic review and meta-analysis of mortality among people
              with mental disorders and examine differences in mortality risks
              by type of death, diagnosis, and study characteristics. DATA
              SOURCES: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Web of
              Science from inception through May 7, 2014, including references
              of eligible articles. Our search strategy included terms for
              mental disorders (eg, mental disorders, serious mental illness,
              and severe mental illness), specific diagnoses (eg,
              schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder), and
              mortality. We also used Google Scholar to identify articles that
              cited eligible articles. STUDY SELECTION: English-language cohort
              studies that reported a mortality estimate of mental disorders
              compared with a general population or controls from the same
              study setting without mental illness were included. Two reviewers
              independently reviewed the titles, abstracts, and articles. Of
              2481 studies identified, 203 articles met the eligibility
              criteria and represented 29 countries in 6 continents. DATA
              EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: One reviewer conducted a full
              abstraction of all data, and 2 reviewers verified accuracy. MAIN
              OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mortality estimates (eg, standardized
              mortality ratios, relative risks, hazard ratios, odds ratios, and
              years of potential life lost) comparing people with mental
              disorders and the general population or people without mental
              disorders. We used random-effects meta-analysis models to pool
              mortality ratios for all, natural, and unnatural causes of death.
              We also examined years of potential life lost and estimated the
              population attributable risk of mortality due to mental
              disorders. RESULTS: For all-cause mortality, the pooled relative
              risk of mortality among those with mental disorders (from 148
              studies) was 2.22 (95\% CI, 2.12-2.33). Of these, 135 studies
              revealed that mortality was significantly higher among people
              with mental disorders than among the comparison population. A
              total of 67.3\% of deaths among people with mental disorders were
              due to natural causes, 17.5\% to unnatural causes, and the
              remainder to other or unknown causes. The median years of
              potential life lost was 10 years (n = 24 studies). We estimate
              that 14.3\% of deaths worldwide, or approximately 8 million
              deaths each year, are attributable to mental disorders.
              CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These estimates suggest that mental
              disorders rank among the most substantial causes of death
              worldwide. Efforts to quantify and address the global burden of
              illness need to better consider the role of mental disorders in

               (\$19 999 or less; OR, 1.7; 95\% CI, 1.49-2.04). Associations of
               MDD with psychiatric disorders ranged from an aOR of 2.1 (95\%
               CI, 1.84-2.35) for specific phobia to an aOR of 5.7 (95\% CI,
               4.98-6.50) for generalized anxiety disorder. Associations of MDD
               with substance use disorders ranged from an aOR of 1.8 (95\% CI,
               1.63-2.01) for alcohol to an aOR of 3.0 (95\% CI, 2.57-3.55) for
               any drug. Most lifetime MDD cases were moderate (39.7\%) or
               severe (49.5\%). Almost 70\% with lifetime MDD had some type of
               treatment. Functioning among those with severe MDD was
               approximately 1 SD below the national mean. Among 12.9\% of
               those with lifetime MDD, all episodes occurred just after the
               death of someone close and lasted less than 2 months. The
               anxious/distressed specifier characterized 74.6\% of MDD cases,
               and the mixed-features specifier characterized 15.5\%.
               Controlling for severity, both specifiers were associated with
               early onset, poor course and functioning, and
               suicidality.Conclusions and RelevanceAmong US adults,DSM-5MDD is
               highly prevalent, comorbid, and disabling. While most cases
               received some treatment, a substantial minority did not. Much

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Patients with major depression respond to
              antidepressant treatment, but 10\%-30\% of them do not improve or
              show a partial response coupled with functional impairment, poor
              quality of life, suicide ideation and attempts, self-injurious
              behavior, and a high relapse rate. The aim of this paper is to
              review the therapeutic options for treating resistant major
              depressive disorder, as well as evaluating further therapeutic
              options. METHODS: In addition to Google Scholar and Quertle
              searches, a PubMed search using key words was conducted, and
              relevant articles published in English peer-reviewed journals
              (1990-2011) were retrieved. Only those papers that directly
              addressed treatment options for treatment-resistant depression
              were retained for extensive review. RESULTS: Treatment-resistant
              depression, a complex clinical problem caused by multiple risk
              factors, is targeted by integrated therapeutic strategies, which
              include optimization of medications, a combination of
              antidepressants, switching of antidepressants, and augmentation
              with non-antidepressants, psychosocial and cultural therapies,
              and somatic therapies including electroconvulsive therapy,
              repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure
              therapy, deep brain stimulation, transcranial direct current
              stimulation, and vagus nerve stimulation. As a corollary, more
              than a third of patients with treatment-resistant depression tend
              to achieve remission and the rest continue to suffer from
              residual symptoms. The latter group of patients needs further
              study to identify the most effective therapeutic modalities.
              Newer biomarker-based antidepressants and other drugs, together
              with non-drug strategies, are on the horizon to address further
              the multiple complex issues of treatment-resistant depression.
              CONCLUSION: Treatment-resistant depression continues to challenge
              mental health care providers, and further relevant research
              involving newer drugs is warranted to improve the quality of life
              of patients with the disorder.",

              among a representative adult population. Two groups at baseline
              were selected to study recurrence and chronicity of MDD at
              follow-up. Diagnoses were assessed with the Composite
              International Diagnostic Interview 3.0. RESULTS: Among remitted
              MDD cases (n = 746), the cumulative recurrence rate was 4.3\% at
              5 years, 13.4\% at 10 years and 27.1\% at 20 years. Time to
              recurrence was predicted by vulnerability characteristics
              (childhood abuse, negative life events, parental
              psychopathology), physical health, functioning, clinical
              characteristics of depression (previous episodes, severity,
              medication use), psychiatric comorbidity and mental health use.
              Among current MDD cases (n = 242), 12\% developed a chronic
              depressive episode over 6 years. Chronic course was predicted by
              similar risk indicators as recurrence, except for vulnerability
              characteristics and physical health. CONCLUSION: These risk
              indicators may help to identify patients requiring monitoring and
              who could benefit from preventive interventions or maintenance
              treatment.",

              improvements in mental health outcomes with psychedelic
              drug-assisted psychotherapy. OBJECTIVES: Here, we report on
              safety and efficacy outcomes for up to 6 months in an open-label
              trial of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. METHODS:
              Twenty patients (six females) with (mostly) severe, unipolar,
              treatment-resistant major depression received two oral doses of
              psilocybin (10 and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting.
              Depressive symptoms were assessed from 1 week to 6 months
              post-treatment, with the self-rated QIDS-SR16 as the primary
              outcome measure. RESULTS: Treatment was generally well tolerated.
              Relative to baseline, marked reductions in depressive symptoms
              were observed for the first 5 weeks post-treatment (Cohen's d =
              2.2 at week 1 and 2.3 at week 5, both p < 0.001); nine and four
              patients met the criteria for response and remission at week 5.
              Results remained positive at 3 and 6 months (Cohen's d = 1.5 and
              1.4, respectively, both p < 0.001). No patients sought
              conventional antidepressant treatment within 5 weeks of
              psilocybin. Reductions in depressive symptoms at 5 weeks were
              predicted by the quality of the acute psychedelic experience.
              CONCLUSIONS: Although limited conclusions can be drawn about
              treatment efficacy from open-label trials, tolerability was good,
              effect sizes large and symptom improvements appeared rapidly
              after just two psilocybin treatment sessions and remained
              significant 6 months post-treatment in a treatment-resistant
              cohort. Psilocybin represents a promising paradigm for
              unresponsive depression that warrants further research in
              double-blind randomised control trials.",

              (directed) connection strengths from fMRI data represents a
              central challenge for computational neuroimaging. A recently
              introduced generative model of fMRI data, regression dynamic
              causal modeling (rDCM), moves towards this goal as it scales
              gracefully to very large networks. However, large-scale networks
              with thousands of connections are difficult to interpret;
              additionally, one typically lacks information (data points per
              free parameter) for precise estimation of all model parameters.
              This paper introduces sparsity constraints to the variational
              Bayesian framework of rDCM as a solution to these problems in the
              domain of task-based fMRI. This sparse rDCM approach enables
              highly efficient effective connectivity analyses in whole-brain
              networks and does not require a priori assumptions about the
              network's connectivity structure but prunes fully (all-to-all)
              connected networks as part of model inversion. Following the
              derivation of the variational Bayesian update equations for
              sparse rDCM, we use both simulated and empirical data to assess
              the face validity of the model. In particular, we show that it is
              feasible to infer effective connection strengths from fMRI data
              using a network with more than 100 regions and 10,000
              connections. This demonstrates the feasibility of whole-brain
              inference on effective connectivity from fMRI data - in single
              subjects and with a run-time below 1 min when using parallelized
              code. We anticipate that sparse rDCM may find useful application
              in connectomics and clinical neuromodeling - for example, for
              phenotyping individual patients in terms of whole-brain network

              been shown to shift emotional biases away from negative towards
              positive stimuli. We have recently shown that reduced amygdala
              activity during threat processing might underlie psilocybin's
              effect on emotional processing. However, it is still not known
              whether psilocybin modulates bottom-up or top-down connectivity
              within the visual-limbic-prefrontal network underlying threat
              processing. We therefore analyzed our previous fMRI data using

              infer how psilocybin modulated effective connectivity within the

              between the primary visual cortex, amygdala, and lateral
              prefrontal cortex. Second, psilocybin decreased the
              threat-induced modulation of top-down connectivity from the
              amygdala to primary visual cortex, speaking to a neural mechanism
              that might underlie putative shifts towards positive affect

              important brain functions and is critically involved in many
              neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we present a high-resolution,
              multidimensional, in vivo atlas of four of the human brain's 5-HT
              receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT4) and the 5-HT
              transporter (5-HTT). The atlas is created from molecular and
              structural high-resolution neuroimaging data consisting of
              positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging
              (MRI) scans acquired in a total of 210 healthy individuals.
              Comparison of the regional PET binding measures with postmortem
              human brain autoradiography outcomes showed a high correlation
              for the five 5-HT targets and this enabled us to transform the
              atlas to represent protein densities (in picomoles per
              milliliter). We also assessed the regional association between
              protein concentration and mRNA expression in the human brain by
              comparing the 5-HT density across the atlas with data from the
              Allen Human Brain atlas and identified receptor- and
              transporter-specific associations that show the regional relation
              between the two measures. Together, these data provide
              unparalleled insight into the serotonin system of the human
              brain. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We present a high-resolution
              positron emission tomography (PET)- and magnetic resonance
              imaging-based human brain atlas of important serotonin receptors
              and the transporter. The regional PET-derived binding measures
              correlate strongly with the corresponding autoradiography protein
              levels. The strong correlation enables the transformation of the
              PET-derived human brain atlas into a protein density map of the
              serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) system. Next, we compared
              the regional receptor/transporter protein densities with mRNA
              levels and uncovered unique associations between protein
              expression and density at high detail. This new in vivo
              neuroimaging atlas of the 5-HT system not only provides insight
              in the human brain's regional protein synthesis, transport, and
              density, but also represents a valuable source of information for

  abstract = "Because of the ethical and regulatory hurdles associated with
              human studies, much of what is known about the psychopharmacology
              of hallucinogens has been derived from animal models. However,
              developing reliable animal models has proven to be a challenging
              task due to the complexity and variability of hallucinogen
              effects in humans. This chapter focuses on three animal models
              that are frequently used to test the effects of hallucinogens on
              unconditioned behavior: head twitch response (HTR), prepulse
              inhibition of startle (PPI), and exploratory behavior. The HTR
              has demonstrated considerable utility in the neurochemical
              actions of hallucinogens. However, the latter two models have
              clearer conceptual bridges to human phenomenology. Consistent
              with the known mechanism of action of hallucinogens in humans,
              the behavioral effects of hallucinogens in rodents are mediated
              primarily by activation of 5-HT2A receptors. There is evidence,
              however, that other receptors may play secondary roles. The
              structure-activity relationships (SAR) of hallucinogens are
              reviewed in relation to each model, with a focus on the HTR in

  abstract = "Psychedelic drugs, including the serotonin 2a (5-HT2A) receptor
              partial agonist psilocybin, are receiving renewed attention for
              their possible efficacy in treating a variety of neuropsychiatric
              disorders. Psilocybin induces widespread dysregulation of
              cortical activity, but circuit-level mechanisms underlying this
              effect are unclear. The claustrum is a subcortical nucleus that
              highly expresses 5-HT2A receptors and provides glutamatergic
              inputs to arguably all areas of the cerebral cortex. We therefore
              tested the hypothesis that psilocybin modulates claustrum
              function in humans. Fifteen healthy participants (10M, 5F)
              completed this within-subjects study in which whole-brain
              resting-state blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal was
              measured 100 ​min after blinded oral administration of placebo
              and 10 mg/70 ​kg psilocybin. Left and right claustrum signal was
              isolated using small region confound correction. Psilocybin
              significantly decreased both the amplitude of low frequency
              fluctuations as well as the variance of BOLD signal in the left
              and right claustrum. Psilocybin also significantly decreased
              functional connectivity of the right claustrum with auditory and
              default mode networks (DMN), increased right claustrum
              connectivity with the fronto-parietal task control network
              (FPTC), and decreased left claustrum connectivity with the FPTC.
              DMN integrity was associated with right-claustrum connectivity
              with the DMN, while FPTC integrity and modularity were associated
              with right claustrum and left claustrum connectivity with the
              FPTC, respectively. Subjective effects of psilocybin predicted
              changes in the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations and the
              variance of BOLD signal in the left and right claustrum. Observed
              effects were specific to claustrum, compared to flanking regions
              of interest (the left and right insula and putamen). This study
              used a pharmacological intervention to provide the first
              empirical evidence in any species for a significant role of
              5-HT2A receptor signaling in claustrum functioning, and supports
              a possible role of the claustrum in the subjective and
              therapeutic effects of psilocybin.",

              for resting-state brain networks based on biophysical models of
              distributed neuronal activity, that is, effective connectivity.
              This identification can be contrasted with functional
              connectivity methods based on symmetric correlations that are
              ubiquitous in resting-state functional MRI (fMRI). We use
              spectral dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to invert large graphs
              comprising dozens of nodes or regions. The ensuing graphs are
              directed and weighted, hence providing a neurobiologically
              plausible characterization of connectivity in terms of excitatory
              and inhibitory coupling. Furthermore, we show that the use of to
              discover the most likely sparse graph (or model) from a parent
              (e.g., fully connected) graph eschews the arbitrary thresholding
              often applied to large symmetric (functional connectivity)
              graphs. Using empirical fMRI data, we show that spectral DCM
              furnishes connectivity estimates on large graphs that correlate
              strongly with the estimates provided by stochastic DCM.
              Furthermore, we increase the efficiency of model inversion using
              functional connectivity modes to place prior constraints on
              effective connectivity. In other words, we use a small number of
              modes to finesse the potentially redundant parameterization of
              large DCMs. We show that spectral DCM-with functional
              connectivity priors-is ideally suited for directed graph
              theoretic analyses of resting-state fMRI. We envision that
              directed graphs will prove useful in understanding the
              psychopathology and pathophysiology of neurodegenerative and
              neurodevelopmental disorders. We will demonstrate the utility of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Psilocybin has shown promise as a treatment for
              depression but its therapeutic mechanisms are not properly
              understood. In contrast to the presumed actions of
              antidepressants, we recently found increased amygdala
              responsiveness to fearful faces one day after open-label
              treatment with psilocybin (25 mg) in 19 patients with
              treatment-resistant depression, which correlated with treatment
              efficacy. AIMS: Aiming to further unravel the therapeutic
              mechanisms of psilocybin, the present study extends this basic
              activation analysis. We hypothesised changed amygdala functional
              connectivity, more precisely decreased amygdala-ventromedial
              prefrontal cortex functional connectivity, during face processing
              after treatment with psilocybin. METHODS: Psychophysiological
              interaction analyses were conducted on functional magnetic
              resonance imaging data from a classic face/emotion perception
              task, with the bilateral amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal
              cortex time-series as physiological regressors. Average parameter
              estimates (beta weights) of significant clusters were correlated
              with clinical outcomes at one week. RESULTS: Results showed
              decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex-right amygdala
              functional connectivity during face processing post- (versus
              pre-) treatment; this decrease was associated with levels of
              rumination at one week. This effect was driven by connectivity
              changes in response to fearful and neutral (but not happy) faces.
              Independent whole-brain analyses also revealed a post-treatment
              increase in functional connectivity between the amygdala and
              ventromedial prefrontal cortex to occipital-parietal cortices
              during face processing. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent
              with the idea that psilocybin therapy revives emotional
              responsiveness on a neural and psychological level, which may be
              a key treatment mechanism for psychedelic therapy. Future larger
              placebo-controlled studies are needed to examine the
              replicability of the current findings.",

  abstract = "Recent advances in brain connectivity methods have made it
              possible to identify hubs-the brain's most globally connected
              regions. Such regions are essential for coordinating brain
              functions due to their connectivity with numerous regions with a
              variety of specializations. Current structural and functional
              connectivity methods generally agree that default mode network
              (DMN) regions have among the highest global brain connectivity
              (GBC). We developed two novel statistical approaches using
              resting state functional connectivity MRI-weighted and unweighted
              GBC (wGBC and uGBC)-to test the hypothesis that the highest
              global connectivity also occurs in the cognitive control network
              (CCN), a network anti-correlated with the DMN across a variety of
              tasks. High global connectivity was found in both CCN and DMN.
              The newly developed wGBC approach improves upon existing methods
              by quantifying inter-subject consistency, quantifying the highest
              GBC values by percentage, and avoiding arbitrarily connection
              strength thresholding. The uGBC approach is based on graph theory
              and includes many of these improvements, but still requires an
              arbitrary connection threshold. We found high GBC in several
              subcortical regions (e.g., hippocampus, basal ganglia) only with
              wGBC despite the regions' extensive anatomical connectivity.
              These results demonstrate the complementary utility of wGBC and
              uGBC analyses for the characterization of the most highly
              connected, and thus most functionally important, regions of the
              brain. Additionally, the high connectivity of both the CCN and
              the DMN demonstrates that brain regions outside primary
              sensory-motor networks are highly involved in coordinating
              information throughout the brain.",

  abstract = "The cerebral cortex receives a dense serotonergic innervation
              originating predominantly from the dorsal raphe nucleus. This
              innervation regulates cortical functioning by activating multiple
              serotonin receptors that are differentially expressed by
              pyramidal cells and interneurons. Electrophysiological studies in
              the prefrontal cortex indicate that receptors of the 5-HT(1A) and
              5-HT(2A) subtypes are the main serotonin receptors regulating
              membrane excitability in pyramidal cells. Most pyramidal cells in
              layer V coexpress 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors that together
              regulate how these neurons encode excitatory input into neuronal
              firing. In contrast, a subset of large pyramidal cells of deep
              layer V appears to express exclusively 5-HT(2A) receptors that
              depolarize and excite these cells. Serotonin also depolarizes and
              excites at least two classes of GABAergic interneurons by acting
              on 5-HT(3) and 5-HT(2A) receptors. The differential expression of
              serotonin receptors in different pyramidal cells and interneurons

              molecular and functional heterogeneity of pyramidal cells and

We tested the hypothesis that normal hypothalamic sexual dimorphism is disrupted in schizophrenia.
Methods
Eighty-eight DSM-III-R schizophrenia cases (40 simplex and 48 multiplex), 43 first-degree nonpsychotic relatives, and 48 normal comparisons systematically were compared. A 1.5-Tesla General Electric scanner was used to acquire structural MRI scans, and contiguous 3.1-mm slices were used to segment anterior and posterior hypothalamus. General linear model for correlated data and generalized estimating equations were used to compare cases, relatives, and controls on right and left hypothalamus, controlled for age, sex, and total cerebral volume. Spearman’s correlations of hypothalamic volumes with anxiety were calculated to begin to examine arousal correlates with structural abnormalities.
Results
Findings demonstrated significantly increased hypothalamic volume in cases and nonpsychotic relatives, particularly in regions of paraventricular and mammillary body nuclei, respectively. This increase was linear from simplex to multiplex cases, was positively correlated with anxiety, and had a greater propensity in women.
Conclusions
Findings suggest important implications for understanding genetic vulnerability of schizophrenia and the high rate of endocrine abnormalities.}

               Second, we test construct validity of rDCM in relation to an

  abstract = "Serotonin receptors of the 5-HT(2A) subtype are robustly

              in the pathophysiology and therapeutics of mental disorders and
              the actions of hallucinogens. Much less is known, however, about

              In the current study we use immunohistochemical and
              electrophysiological approaches in genetically modified mice to
              address the expression of the Htr2a gene and 5-HT(2A) receptors
              in cortex. We first use an EGFP-expressing BAC transgenic mice
              and identify three main Htr2A gene expressing neuronal
              populations in cortex. The largest of these cell populations
              corresponds to layer V pyramidal cells of the anterior cortex,
              followed by GABAergic interneurons of the middle layers, and
              non-pyramidal cells of the subplate/Layer VIb. We then use
              5-HT(2A) receptor knockout mice to identify an antibody capable
              of localizing 5-HT(2A) receptors in brain and use it to map these

              that closely matches the localization of Htr2A expressing
              pyramidal cells of layer V. Finally we use electrophysiological
              and immunohistochemical approaches to show that most, but not
              all, GABAergic interneurons of the middle layers are parvalbumin
              expressing Fast-spiking interneurons and that these cells are
              depolarized and excited by serotonin, most likely through the
              activation of 5-HT(2A) receptors. These results clarify and

  author    = "Carhart-Harris, R L and Friston, K J",
  abstract  = "This paper formulates the action of psychedelics by integrating
               the free-energy principle and entropic brain hypothesis. We call
               this formulation relaxed beliefs under psychedelics (REBUS) and
               the anarchic brain, founded on the principle that---via their
               entropic effect on spontaneous cortical activity---psychedelics
               work to relax the precision of high-level priors or beliefs,
               thereby liberating bottom-up information flow, particularly via
               intrinsic sources such as the limbic system. We assemble
               evidence for this model and show how it can explain a broad
               range of phenomena associated with the psychedelic experience.
               With regard to their potential therapeutic use, we propose that
               psychedelics work to relax the precision weighting of
               pathologically overweighted priors underpinning various
               expressions of mental illness. We propose that this process
               entails an increased sensitization of high-level priors to
               bottom-up signaling (stemming from intrinsic sources), and that
               this heightened sensitivity enables the potential revision and
               deweighting of overweighted priors. We end by discussing further
               implications of the model, such as that psychedelics can bring
               about the revision of other heavily weighted high-level priors,
               not directly related to mental health, such as those underlying
               partisan and/or overly-confident political, religious, and/or
               philosophical perspectives.Significance Statement Psychedelics
               are capturing interest, with efforts underway to bring
               psilocybin therapy to marketing authorisation and legal access
               within a decade, spearheaded by the findings of a series of
               phase 2 trials. In this climate, a compelling unified model of
               how psychedelics alter brain function to alter consciousness
               would have appeal. Towards this end, we have sought to integrate
               a leading model of global brain function, hierarchical
               predictive coding, with an often-cited model of the acute action
               of psychedelics, the entropic brain hypothesis. The resulting
               synthesis states that psychedelics work to relax high-level
               priors, sensitising them to liberated bottom-up information
               flow, which, with the right intention, care provision and
               context, can help guide and cultivate the revision of entrenched
               pathological priors.",

              research on altered states of consciousness (ASC). It measures
              three primary and one secondary dimensions of ASC that are
              hypothesized to be invariant across ASC induction methods. The
              OAV rating scale has been in use for more than 20 years and
              applied internationally in a broad range of research fields, yet
              its factorial structure has never been tested by structural
              equation modeling techniques and its psychometric properties have
              never been examined in large samples of experimentally induced
              ASC. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The present study conducted
              a psychometric evaluation of the OAV in a sample of psilocybin (n
              = 327), ketamine (n = 162), and MDMA (n = 102) induced ASC that
              was obtained by pooling data from 43 experimental studies. The
              factorial structure was examined by confirmatory factor analysis,
              exploratory structural equation modeling, hierarchical item
              clustering (ICLUST), and multiple indicators multiple causes
              (MIMIC) modeling. The originally proposed model did not fit the
              data well even if zero-constraints on non-target factor loadings
              and residual correlations were relaxed. Furthermore, ICLUST
              suggested that the ``oceanic boundlessness'' and ``visionary
              restructuralization'' factors could be combined on a high level
              of the construct hierarchy. However, because these factors were
              multidimensional, we extracted and examined 11 new lower order
              factors. MIMIC modeling indicated that these factors were highly
              measurement invariant across drugs, settings, questionnaire
              versions, and sexes. The new factors were also demonstrated to
              have improved homogeneities, satisfactory reliabilities,
              discriminant and convergent validities, and to differentiate well
              among the three drug groups. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The
              original scales of the OAV were shown to be multidimensional
              constructs. Eleven new lower order scales were constructed and
              demonstrated to have desirable psychometric properties. The new
              lower order scales are most likely better suited to assess drug
              induced ASC.",

              individuals being misdiagnosed with MDD. The amygdala is a key
              region implicated in processing emotionally salient stimuli,
              including emotional facial expressions. It is unclear, however,
              whether abnormal amygdala activity during positive and negative
              emotion processing represents a persistent marker of BD
              regardless of illness phase or a state marker of depression
              common or specific to BD and MDD depression. METHODS: Sixty
              adults were recruited: 15 depressed with BD type 1 (BDd), 15
              depressed with recurrent MDD, 15 with BD in remission (BDr),
              diagnosed with DSM-IV and Structured Clinical Interview for

              were matched for age of illness onset and illness duration;
              depressed groups were matched for depression severity. The BDd
              were taking more psychotropic medication than other patient

              construction of brain networks from connectivity data and
              describe the most commonly used network measures of structural
              and functional connectivity. We describe measures that variously
              detect functional integration and segregation, quantify
              centrality of individual brain regions or pathways, characterize
              patterns of local anatomical circuitry, and test resilience of
              networks to insult. We discuss the issues surrounding comparison
              of structural and functional network connectivity, as well as
              comparison of networks across subjects. Finally, we describe a

              clinical contexts has triggered renewed interest in the mechanism
              of action of psychedelics. However, its time-dependent
              systems-level neurobiology remains sparsely investigated in
              humans. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized,
              counterbalanced, crossover study comprising 23 healthy human
              participants who received placebo and 0.2 mg/kg of psilocybin
              orally on 2 different test days. Participants underwent magnetic
              resonance imaging at 3 time points between administration and
              peak effects: 20 minutes, 40 minutes, and 70 minutes after
              administration. Resting-state functional connectivity was
              quantified via a data-driven global brain connectivity method and
              compared with cortical gene expression maps. RESULTS: Psilocybin
              reduced associative, but concurrently increased sensory,
              brain-wide connectivity. This pattern emerged over time from
              administration to peak effects. Furthermore, we showed that
              baseline connectivity is associated with the extent of
              psilocybin-induced changes in functional connectivity. Lastly,
              psilocybin-induced changes correlated in a time-dependent manner
              with spatial gene expression patterns of the 5-HT2A
              (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A) and 5-HT1A (5-hydroxytryptamine 1A)

              integration of functional connectivity in sensory regions and the
              disintegration in associative regions may underlie the
              psychedelic state and pinpoint the critical role of the serotonin
              2A and 1A receptor systems. Furthermore, baseline connectivity
              may represent a predictive marker of the magnitude of changes
              induced by psilocybin and may therefore contribute to a
              personalized medicine approach within the potential framework of

  abstract  = "Decoding models, such as those underlying multivariate
               classification algorithms, have been increasingly used to infer
               cognitive or clinical brain states from measures of brain
               activity obtained by functional magnetic resonance imaging
               (fMRI). The practicality of current classifiers, however, is
               restricted by two major challenges. First, due to the high data
               dimensionality and low sample size, algorithms struggle to
               separate informative from uninformative features, resulting in
               poor generalization performance. Second, popular discriminative
               methods such as support vector machines (SVMs) rarely afford
               mechanistic interpretability. In this paper, we address these
               issues by proposing a novel generative-embedding approach that
               incorporates neurobiologically interpretable generative models
               into discriminative classifiers. Our approach extends previous
               work on trial-by-trial classification for electrophysiological
               recordings to subject-by-subject classification for fMRI and
               offers two key advantages over conventional methods: it may
               provide more accurate predictions by exploiting discriminative
               information encoded in `hidden' physiological quantities such as
               synaptic connection strengths; and it affords mechanistic
               interpretability of clinical classifications. Here, we introduce
               generative embedding for fMRI using a combination of dynamic
               causal models (DCMs) and SVMs. We propose a general procedure of
               DCM-based generative embedding for subject-wise classification,
               provide a concrete implementation, and suggest good-practice
               guidelines for unbiased application of generative embedding in
               the context of fMRI. We illustrate the utility of our approach
               by a clinical example in which we classify moderately aphasic
               patients and healthy controls using a DCM of thalamo-temporal
               regions during speech processing. Generative embedding achieves
               a near-perfect balanced classification accuracy of 98\% and
               significantly outperforms conventional activation-based and
               correlation-based methods. This example demonstrates how disease
               states can be detected with very high accuracy and, at the same
               time, be interpreted mechanistically in terms of abnormalities
               in connectivity. We envisage that future applications of
               generative embedding may provide crucial advances in dissecting
               spectrum disorders into physiologically more well-defined
               subgroups.",

              support may be effective for treating depression. Some studies
              have found that patients with depression show heightened amygdala
              responses to fearful faces and there is reliable evidence that
              treatment with SSRIs attenuates amygdala responses (Ma, 2015). We
              hypothesised that amygdala responses to emotional faces would be
              altered post-treatment with psilocybin. In this open-label study,
              20 individuals diagnosed with moderate to severe,
              treatment-resistant depression, underwent two separate dosing
              sessions with psilocybin. Psychological support was provided
              before, during and after these sessions and 19 completed fMRI
              scans one week prior to the first session and one day after the
              second and last. Neutral, fearful and happy faces were presented
              in the scanner and analyses focused on the amygdala. Group
              results revealed rapid and enduring improvements in depressive
              symptoms post psilocybin. Increased responses to fearful and
              happy faces were observed in the right amygdala post-treatment,
              and right amygdala increases to fearful versus neutral faces were
              predictive of clinical improvements at 1-week. Psilocybin with
              psychological support was associated with increased amygdala
              responses to emotional stimuli, an opposite effect to previous
              findings with SSRIs. This suggests fundamental differences in
              these treatments' therapeutic actions, with SSRIs mitigating
              negative emotions and psilocybin allowing patients to confront
              and work through them. Based on the present results, we propose
              that psilocybin with psychological support is a treatment
              approach that potentially revives emotional responsiveness in
              depression, enabling patients to reconnect with their emotions.

              underspecified. This systematic meta-analysis summarizes
              pharmacological neuroimaging studies (before February 2013) and
              the antidepressant effects on human brain activity underlying
              emotional processes. Sixty fMRI studies (involving 1569 subjects)
              applying antidepressants vs control were included in the current
              quantitative Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE)
              meta-analysis. Pooling of results by ALE meta-analyses was
              stratified for population (mood disorder patients/healthy
              volunteers), emotional valence (positive/negative emotions) and
              treatment effects (increased/decreased brain activity). For both
              patients and healthy volunteers, the medial prefrontal and core
              limbic parts of the emotional network (for example, anterior
              cingulate, amygdala and thalamus) were increased in response to
              positive emotions but decreased to negative emotions by repeated
              antidepressant administration. Moreover, selective antidepressant
              effects were uncovered in patients and healthy volunteers,
              respectively. Antidepressants increased activity in the
              dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC), a key region mediating emotion
              regulation, during both negative and positive emotions in
              patients. Repeated antidepressant administration decreased brain
              responses to positive emotions in the nucleus accumbens, putamen,
              medial prefrontal and midbrain in healthy volunteers.
              Antidepressants act to normalize abnormal neural responses in
              depressed patients by increasing brain activity to positive
              stimuli and decreasing activity to negative stimuli in the
              emotional network, and increasing engagement of the regulatory
              mechanism in dlPFC.",

              antidepressant effects of ayahuasca, we conducted a parallel-arm,
              double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in 29 patients
              with treatment-resistant depression. Patients received a single
              dose of either ayahuasca or placebo. We assessed changes in
              depression severity with the Montgomery-{\AA}sberg Depression
              Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Hamilton Depression Rating scale at
              baseline, and at 1 (D1), 2 (D2), and 7 (D7) days after dosing.
              RESULTS: We observed significant antidepressant effects of
              ayahuasca when compared with placebo at all-time points. MADRS
              scores were significantly lower in the ayahuasca group compared
              with placebo at D1 and D2 (p = 0.04), and at D7 (p < 0.0001).
              Between-group effect sizes increased from D1 to D7 (D1: Cohen's d
              = 0.84; D2: Cohen's d = 0.84; D7: Cohen's d = 1.49). Response
              rates were high for both groups at D1 and D2, and significantly
              higher in the ayahuasca group at D7 (64\% v. 27\%; p = 0.04).
              Remission rate showed a trend toward significance at D7 (36\% v.

              with regional hyperactivity in cortico-striatal circuits.
              However, the large-scale patterns of abnormal neural connectivity
              remain uncharacterized. Resting-state functional connectivity
              studies have shown altered connectivity within the implicated
              circuitry, but they have used seed-driven approaches wherein a
              circuit of interest is defined a priori. This limits their
              ability to identify network abnormalities beyond the prevailing
              framework. This limitation is particularly problematic within the
              prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is large and heterogeneous and
              where a priori specification of seeds is therefore difficult. A
              hypothesis-neutral, data-driven approach to the analysis of
              connectivity is vital. METHODS: We analyzed resting-state
              functional connectivity data collected at 3T in 27 OCD patients
              and 66 matched control subjects with a recently developed
              data-driven global brain connectivity (GBC) method, both within
              the PFC and across the whole brain. RESULTS: We found clusters of
              decreased connectivity in the left lateral PFC in both
              whole-brain and PFC-restricted analyses. Increased GBC was found
              in the right putamen and left cerebellar cortex. Within regions
              of interest in the basal ganglia and thalamus, we identified
              increased GBC in dorsal striatum and anterior thalamus, which was
              reduced in patients on medication. The ventral striatum/nucleus
              accumbens exhibited decreased global connectivity but increased
              connectivity specifically with the ventral anterior cingulate
              cortex in subjects with OCD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify
              previously uncharacterized PFC and basal ganglia dysconnectivity
              in OCD and reveal differentially altered GBC in dorsal and
              ventral striatum. Results highlight complex disturbances in PFC
              networks, which could contribute to disrupted
              cortical-striatal-cerebellar circuits in OCD.",

              function have largely failed to achieve consensus. In this
              present synthesis, we integrate previous perspectives with new
              and older data to create a novel bipartite model centred on the
              view that serotonin neurotransmission enhances two distinct
              adaptive responses to adversity, mediated in large part by its
              two most prevalent and researched brain receptors: the 5-HT1A and
              5-HT2A receptors. We propose that passive coping (i.e. tolerating
              a source of stress) is mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1AR
              signalling and characterised by stress moderation. Conversely, we
              argue that active coping (i.e. actively addressing a source of
              stress) is mediated by 5-HT2AR signalling and characterised by
              enhanced plasticity (defined as capacity for change). We propose
              that 5-HT1AR-mediated stress moderation may be the brain's
              default response to adversity but that an improved ability to
              change one's situation and/or relationship to it via
              5-HT2AR-mediated plasticity may also be important - and
              increasingly so as the level of adversity reaches a critical
              point. We propose that the 5-HT1AR pathway is enhanced by
              conventional 5-HT reuptake blocking antidepressants such as the
              selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), whereas the
              5-HT2AR pathway is enhanced by 5-HT2AR-agonist psychedelics. This
              bipartite model purports to explain how different drugs (SSRIs
              and psychedelics) that modulate the serotonergic system in
              different ways, can achieve complementary adaptive and

              conditions, revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD
              that correlated strongly with its characteristic psychological
              effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF),
              decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly expanded
              primary visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile
              correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations,
              implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence
              on visual processing in the psychedelic state, thereby defining
              its hallucinatory quality. LSD's marked effects on the visual
              cortex did not significantly correlate with the drug's other
              characteristic effects on consciousness, however. Rather,
              decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and

              changes in directed (effective) connectivity between selected
              CTSC regions after acute administration of lysergic acid
              diethylamide (LSD), and after pretreatment with Ketanserin (a

              double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in

              were specified for each treatment condition to investigate the
              connectivity between the following areas: thalamus, ventral
              striatum, posterior cingulate cortex, and temporal cortex. Our
              results confirm major predictions proposed in the CSTC model and
              provide evidence that LSD alters effective connectivity within
              CSTC pathways that have been implicated in the gating of sensory
              and sensorimotor information to the cortex. In particular, LSD
              increased effective connectivity from the thalamus to the
              posterior cingulate cortex in a way that depended on serotonin 2A
              receptor activation, and decreased effective connectivity from
              the ventral striatum to the thalamus independently of serotonin
              2A receptor activation. Together, these results advance our

  abstract = "The cortical dorsal attention network (DAN) is a set of parietal
              and frontal regions that support a wide variety of attentionally
              demanding tasks. Whereas attentional deployment reliably drives
              DAN activity across subjects, there is a large degree of
              variation in the activation pattern in individual subjects. We
              hypothesize that a subject's own idiosyncratic pattern of
              cortical DAN activity can be predicted from that subject's own
              unique pattern of functional connectivity. By modeling task
              activation as a function of whole brain connectivity patterns, we
              are able to define the connectivity fingerprints for the frontal
              and parietal DAN, and use it to predict a subject's
              characteristic DAN activation pattern with high accuracy. These
              predictions outperform the standard group-average benchmark and
              predict a subject's own activation pattern above and beyond
              predictions from another subject's connectivity pattern. Thus an
              individual's distinctive connectivity pattern accounts for
              substantial variance in DAN functional responses. Last, we show
              that the set of connections that predict cortical DAN responses,
              the frontal and parietal DAN connectivity fingerprints, is
              predominantly composed of other coactive regions, including
              regions outside of the DAN including occipital and temporal
              visual cortices. These connectivity fingerprints represent
              defining computational characteristics of the DAN, delineating
              which voxels are or are not capable of exerting top-down
              attentional bias to other regions of the brain. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY
              The dorsal attention network (DAN) is a set of regions in
              frontoparietal cortex that reliably activate during attentional
              tasks. We designed computational models that predict the degree
              of an individual's DAN activation using their resting-state
              connectivity pattern alone. This uncovered the connectivity
              fingerprints of the DAN, which define it so well that we can
              predict how a voxel will respond to an attentional task given
              only its pattern of connectivity, with outstanding accuracy.",

              substances such as LSD is a powerful method for interrogating and
              understanding how mind interfaces with brain, by connecting novel
              psychological phenomena with their neurobiological correlates.
              LSD is known to increase measures of brain complexity,
              potentially reflecting a neurobiological correlate of the
              especially rich phenomenological content of psychedelic-induced
              experiences. Yet although the subjective stream of consciousness
              is a constant ebb and flow, no studies to date have investigated
              how LSD influences the dynamics of functional connectivity in the
              human brain. Focusing on the two fundamental network properties
              of integration and segregation, here we combined graph theory and
              dynamic functional connectivity from resting-state functional MRI
              to examine time-resolved effects of LSD on brain networks
              properties and subjective experiences. Our main finding is that
              the effects of LSD on brain function and subjective experience
              are non-uniform in time: LSD makes globally segregated sub-states
              of dynamic functional connectivity more complex, and weakens the
              relationship between functional and anatomical connectivity. On a
              regional level, LSD reduces functional connectivity of the
              anterior medial prefrontal cortex, specifically during states of
              high segregation. Time-specific effects were correlated with
              different aspects of subjective experiences; in particular, ego
              dissolution was predicted by increased small-world organisation
              during a state of high global integration. These results reveal a
              more nuanced, temporally-specific picture of altered brain
              connectivity and complexity under psychedelics than has
              previously been reported.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is a disabling
              neuropsychiatric condition that is associated with disrupted
              functional connectivity across brain networks. The precise nature
              of altered connectivity, however, remains incompletely
              understood. The current study was designed to examine the
              coherence of large-scale connectivity in depression using a
              recently developed technique termed global brain connectivity.
              METHODS: A total of 82 subjects, including medication-free
              patients with major depression (n = 57) and healthy volunteers (n
              = 25) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging with
              resting data acquisition for functional connectivity analysis.
              Global brain connectivity was computed as the mean of each
              voxel's time series correlation with every other voxel and
              compared between study groups. Relationships between global
              connectivity and depressive symptom severity measured using the
              Montgomery-{\AA}sberg Depression Rating Scale were examined by
              means of linear correlation. RESULTS: Relative to the healthy
              group, patients with depression evidenced reduced global
              connectivity bilaterally within multiple regions of medial and
              lateral prefrontal cortex. The largest between-group difference
              was observed within the right subgenual anterior cingulate
              cortex, extending into ventromedial prefrontal cortex bilaterally
              (Hedges' g = -1.48, P < 0.000001). Within the depressed group,
              patients with the lowest connectivity evidenced the highest
              symptom severity within ventromedial prefrontal cortex (r =
              -0.47, P = 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with major depressive
              evidenced abnormal large-scale functional coherence in the brain
              that was centered within the subgenual cingulate cortex, and
              medial prefrontal cortex more broadly. These data extend prior
              studies of connectivity in depression and demonstrate that
              functional disconnection of the medial prefrontal cortex is a key
              pathological feature of the disorder. Hum Brain Mapp

              administration of the psychedelic psilocybin (315 $\mu$g/kg p.o.)

              meditation forms. The analysis of functional connectivity
              identified psilocybin-related and mental state--dependent
              alterations in self-referential processing regions of the default
              mode network (DMN). Notably, decoupling of medial prefrontal and
              posterior cingulate cortices, which is thought to mediate sense

              neuroscience. Dynamic causal models (DCMs) of neuroimaging and
              electrophysiological data are frequently used for inferring
              effective connectivity but are presently restricted to small
              graphs (typically up to 10 regions) in order to keep model
              inversion computationally feasible. Here, we present a novel
              variant of DCM for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
              data that is suited to assess effective connectivity in large
              (whole-brain) networks. The approach rests on translating a
              linear DCM into the frequency domain and reformulating it as a
              special case of Bayesian linear regression. This paper derives
              regression DCM (rDCM) in detail and presents a variational
              Bayesian inversion method that enables extremely fast inference
              and accelerates model inversion by several orders of magnitude
              compared to classical DCM. Using both simulated and empirical
              data, we demonstrate the face validity of rDCM under different
              settings of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and repetition time (TR)
              of fMRI data. In particular, we assess the potential utility of
              rDCM as a tool for whole-brain connectomics by challenging it to
              infer effective connection strengths in a simulated whole-brain
              network comprising 66 regions and 300 free parameters. Our
              results indicate that rDCM represents a computationally highly
              efficient approach with promising potential for inferring
              whole-brain connectivity from individual fMRI data.",

  abstract = "Background: Ayahuasca is a plant tea containing the psychedelic
              5-HT2A agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine and harmala
              monoamine-oxidase inhibitors. Acute administration leads to
              neurophysiological modifications in brain regions of the default
              mode network, purportedly through a glutamatergic mechanism.
              Post-acutely, ayahuasca potentiates mindfulness capacities in
              volunteers and induces rapid and sustained antidepressant effects
              in treatment-resistant patients. However, the mechanisms
              underlying these fast and maintained effects are poorly
              understood. Here, we investigated in an open-label uncontrolled
              study in 16 healthy volunteers ayahuasca-induced post-acute
              neurometabolic and connectivity modifications and their
              association with mindfulness measures. Methods: Using 1H-magnetic
              resonance spectroscopy and functional connectivity, we compared
              baseline and post-acute neurometabolites and seed-to-voxel
              connectivity in the posterior and anterior cingulate cortex after
              a single ayahuasca dose. Results: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy
              showed post-acute reductions in glutamate+glutamine, creatine,
              and N-acetylaspartate+N-acetylaspartylglutamate in the posterior
              cingulate cortex. Connectivity was increased between the
              posterior cingulate cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, and
              between the anterior cingulate cortex and limbic structures in
              the right medial temporal lobe. Glutamate+glutamine reductions
              correlated with increases in the ``nonjudging'' subscale of the
              Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire. Increased anterior
              cingulate cortex-medial temporal lobe connectivity correlated
              with increased scores on the self-compassion questionnaire.
              Post-acute neural changes predicted sustained elevations in
              nonjudging 2 months later. Conclusions: These results support the
              involvement of glutamate neurotransmission in the effects of
              psychedelics in humans. They further suggest that neurometabolic
              changes in the posterior cingulate cortex, a key region within
              the default mode network, and increased connectivity between the
              anterior cingulate cortex and medial temporal lobe structures
              involved in emotion and memory potentially underlie the
              post-acute psychological effects of ayahuasca.",

              depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind,
              cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low

              mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence
              with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up.
              Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy

              High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and

              increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Although previous meta-analyses have examined effects
              of antidepressants, psychotherapy, and alternative therapies for
              depression, the efficacy of these treatments alone and in
              combination has not been systematically compared. We hypothesized
              that the differences between approved depression treatments and
              controls would be small. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The authors first
              reviewed data from Food and Drug Administration Summary Basis of
              Approval reports of 62 pivotal antidepressant trials consisting
              of data from 13,802 depressed patients. This was followed by a
              systematic review of data from 115 published trials evaluating
              efficacy of psychotherapies and alternative therapies for
              depression. The published depression trials consisted of 10,310
              depressed patients. We assessed the percentage symptom reduction
              experienced by the patients based on treatment assignment.
              Overall, antidepressants led to greater symptom reduction
              compared to placebo among both unpublished FDA data and published
              trials (F = 38.5, df = 239, p<0.001). In the published trials we
              noted that the magnitude of symptom reduction with active
              depression treatments compared to controls was significantly
              larger when raters evaluating treatment effects were un-blinded
              compared to the trials with blinded raters (F = 2.17, df = 313,
              p<0.05). In the blinded trials, the combination of
              antidepressants and psychotherapy provided a slight advantage
              over antidepressants (p = 0.027) and psychotherapy (p = 0.022)
              alone. The magnitude of symptom reduction was greater with
              psychotherapies compared to placebo (p = 0.019),
              treatment-as-usual (p = 0.012) and waiting-list (p<0.001).
              Differences were not seen with psychotherapy compared to
              antidepressants, alternative therapies or active intervention
              controls. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the combination of
              psychotherapy and antidepressants for depression may provide a
              slight advantage whereas antidepressants alone and psychotherapy
              alone are not significantly different from alternative therapies
              or active intervention controls. These data suggest that type of
              treatment offered is less important than getting depressed
              patients involved in an active therapeutic program. Future
              research should consider whether certain patient profiles might
              justify a specific treatment modality.",

              while some patients experience swift recovery, others show
              relapsing-remitting or chronic courses. Predicting individual
              clinical trajectories at an early stage is a key challenge for
              psychiatry and might facilitate individually tailored
              interventions. So far, however, reliable predictors at the
              single-patient level are absent. Here, we evaluated the utility
              of a machine learning strategy - generative embedding (GE) -
              which combines interpretable generative models with
              discriminative classifiers. Specifically, we used functional
              magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of emotional face
              perception in 85 MDD patients from the NEtherlands Study of
              Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) who had been followed up over two
              years and classified into three subgroups with distinct clinical
              trajectories. Combining a generative model of effective
              (directed) connectivity with support vector machines (SVMs), we
              could predict whether a given patient would experience chronic
              depression vs. fast remission with a balanced accuracy of 79\%.
              Gradual improvement vs. fast remission could still be predicted
              above-chance, but less convincingly, with a balanced accuracy of
              61\%. Generative embedding outperformed classification based on
              conventional (descriptive) features, such as functional
              connectivity or local activation estimates, which were obtained
              from the same data and did not allow for above-chance
              classification accuracy. Furthermore, predictive performance of
              GE could be assigned to a specific network property: the
              trial-by-trial modulation of connections by emotional content.
              Given the limited sample size of our study, the present results
              are preliminary but may serve as proof-of-concept, illustrating
              the potential of GE for obtaining clinical predictions that are
              interpretable in terms of network mechanisms. Our findings
              suggest that abnormal dynamic changes of connections involved in
              emotional face processing might be associated with higher risk of
              developing a less favorable clinical course.",

              techniques. In this paper, recent mathematical models of this
              hemodynamic response are reviewed and integrated. Models are
              described for: (1) the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
              signal as a function of changes in cerebral oxygen extraction
              fraction (E) and cerebral blood volume (CBV); (2) the balloon
              model, proposed to describe the transient dynamics of CBV and
              deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) and how they affect the BOLD signal; (3)
              neurovascular coupling, relating the responses in CBF and
              cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) to the neural
              activity response; and (4) a simple model for the temporal
              nonlinearity of the neural response itself. These models are
              integrated into a mathematical framework describing the steps
              linking a stimulus to the measured BOLD and CBF responses.
              Experimental results examining transient features of the BOLD
              response (post-stimulus undershoot and initial dip),
              nonlinearities of the hemodynamic response, and the role of the
              physiologic baseline state in altering the BOLD signal are
              discussed in the context of the proposed models. Quantitative
              modeling of the hemodynamic response, when combined with
              experimental data measuring both the BOLD and CBF responses,
              makes possible a more specific and quantitative assessment of
              brain physiology than is possible with standard BOLD imaging
              alone. This approach has the potential to enhance numerous
              studies of brain function in development, health, and disease.",

The model incorporates the conflicting effects of dynamic changes in both blood oxygenation and blood volume. Calculations based on the model show pronounced transients in the deoxyhemoglobin content and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal measured with functional MRI, including initial dips and overshoots and a prolonged post-stimulus undershoot of the BOLD signal. Furthermore, these transient effects can occur in the presence of tight coupling of cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism throughout the activation period. An initial test of the model against experimental measurements of flow and BOLD changes during a finger-tapping task showed good agreement.},

              visual and motor stimulus paradigms. Changes in blood oxygenation
              were detected by using a gradient echo (GE) imaging sequence
              sensitive to the paramagnetic state of deoxygenated hemoglobin.
              Blood flow changes were evaluated by a spin-echo inversion
              recovery (IR), tissue relaxation parameter T1-sensitive pulse
              sequence. A series of images were acquired continuously with the
              same imaging pulse sequence (either GE or IR) during task
              activation. Cine display of subtraction images (activated minus
              baseline) directly demonstrates activity-induced changes in brain
              MR signal observed at a temporal resolution of seconds. During
              8-Hz patterned-flash photic stimulation, a significant increase
              in signal intensity (paired t test; P less than 0.001) of 1.8\%

  title    = "Test-retest reliability of regression dynamic causal modeling",
  author   = "Fr{\"a}ssle, Stefan and Stephan, Klaas E",
  abstract = "Regression dynamic causal modeling (rDCM) is a novel and
              computationally highly efficient method for inferring effective
              connectivity at the whole-brain level. While face and construct
              validity of rDCM have already been demonstrated, here we assessed
              its test-retest reliability -- a test-theoretical property of
              particular importance for clinical applications -- together with
              group-level consistency of connection-specific estimates and
              consistency of whole-brain connectivity patterns over sessions.
              Using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset for eight
              different paradigms (tasks and rest) and two different
              parcellation schemes, we found that rDCM provided highly
              consistent connectivity estimates at the group level across
              sessions. Second, while test-retest reliability was limited when
              averaging over all connections (range of mean ICC 0.24-0.42 over
              tasks), reliability increased with connection strength, with
              stronger connections showing good to excellent test-retest
              reliability. Third, whole-brain connectivity patterns by rDCM
              allowed for identifying individual participants with high (and in
              some cases perfect) accuracy. Comparing the test-retest
              reliability of rDCM connectivity estimates to measures of
              functional connectivity, rDCM performed favorably -- particularly
              when focusing on strong connections. Generally, for all methods
              and metrics, task-based connectivity estimates showed greater
              reliability than those from the resting state. Our results
              underscore the potential of rDCM for human connectomics and
              clinical applications. Author Summary Test-retest reliability is
              an important prerequisite for the validity of connectivity
              estimates in many situations, particularly in clinical
              applications. Here, using different datasets from the Human
              Connectome Project, we demonstrate that regression DCM (rDCM)
              yields good to excellent test-retest reliability when focusing on
              strong connections. Comparing this to the test-retest reliability
              of functional connectivity measures, rDCM performed favorably in
              most cases. Furthermore, we show that reliability is not
              homogeneously distributed: we identified several regions
              (primarily in frontal and temporal lobe) that were linked via
              highly-reliable connections, regardless of the paradigm. Finally,
              we demonstrate that individual connectivity profiles are
              sufficiently unique that participants can be identified with high
              accuracy. Our findings emphasize the potential of rDCM for robust
              inference on directed ``connectivity fingerprints'' from fMRI

ABSTRACT={Statistical machine learning methods are increasingly used for neuroimaging data analysis. Their main virtue is their ability to model high-dimensional datasets, e.g., multivariate analysis of activation images or resting-state time series. Supervised learning is typically used in decoding or encoding settings to relate brain images to behavioral or clinical observations, while unsupervised learning can uncover hidden structures in sets of images (e.g., resting state functional MRI) or find sub-populations in large cohorts. By considering different functional neuroimaging applications, we illustrate how scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library, can be used to perform some key analysis steps. Scikit-learn contains a very large set of statistical learning algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised, and its application to neuroimaging data provides a versatile tool to study the brain.}

abstract="Fluctuations in brain on-going activity can be used to reveal its intrinsic functional organization. To mine this information, we give a new hierarchical probabilistic model for brain activity patterns that does not require an experimental design to be specified. We estimate this model in the dictionary learning framework, learning simultaneously latent spatial maps and the corresponding brain activity time-series. Unlike previous dictionary learning frameworks, we introduce an explicit difference between subject-level spatial maps and their corresponding population-level maps, forming an atlas. We give a novel algorithm using convex optimization techniques to solve efficiently this problem with non-smooth penalties well-suited to image denoising. We show on simulated data that it can recover population-level maps as well as subject specificities. On resting-state fMRI data, we extract the first atlas of spontaneous brain activity and show how it defines a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain in localized regions.",

abstract="Functional brain connectivity, as revealed through distant correlations in the signals measured by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), is a promising source of biomarkers of brain pathologies. However, establishing and using diagnostic markers requires probabilistic inter-subject comparisons. Principled comparison of functional-connectivity structures is still a challenging issue. We give a new matrix-variate probabilistic model suitable for inter-subject comparison of functional connectivity matrices on the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. We show that this model leads to a new algorithm for principled comparison of connectivity coefficients between pairs of regions. We apply this model to comparing separately post-stroke patients to a group of healthy controls. We find neurologically-relevant connection differences and show that our model is more sensitive that the standard procedure. To the best of our knowledge, these results are the first report of functional connectivity differences between a single-patient and a group and thus establish an important step toward using functional connectivity as a diagnostic tool.",

               diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive
               study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used

              framework, suggested a new pair of cognitive styles for
              agent-centered decision-making (DM),
              context-dependency/independency (CD/CI), quantified by the
              Cognitive Bias Task (CBT) and supposedly reflecting functional
              brain hemispheric specialization. To date, there are only three
              lesion and activation neuroimaging studies on the CBT with the
              largest sample of 12 participants. The present study is the first
              to analyze whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) of the
              dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), involved in contextual
              agent-centered DM. METHOD: We compared whole-brain resting-state
              FC of the DLPFC between CD (n = 24) and CI (n = 22) healthy
              participants. Additionally, we investigated associations between
              CD/CI and different aspects of executive functions. RESULTS: CD
              participants had stronger positive FC of the DLPFC with motor and
              visual regions; FC of the left DLPFC was more extensive. CI
              participants had stronger positive FC of the left DLPFC with
              right prefrontal and parietal-occipital areas and of the left and
              right DLPFC with ipsilateral cerebellar hemispheres. No sex
              differences were found. CD/CI had nonlinear associations with
              working memory. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that CD and CI
              are associated with different patterns of DLPFC FC. While CD is
              associated with FC between DLPFC and areas presumably involved in
              storing representations of current situation, CI is more likely
              to be associated with FC between DLPFC and right-lateralized
              associative regions, probably involved in the inhibition of the
              CD response and switching from processing of incoming perceptual

              advantages and potential pitfalls and disadvantages. One major
              concern is that the fMRI signal shows substantial within- and

              help to build new models on disorder mechanisms. Furthermore,
              better control of parameters that may have an influence on the

  abstract = "There is great interest in estimating brain ``networks'' from
              FMRI data. This is often attempted by identifying a set of
              functional ``nodes'' (e.g., spatial ROIs or ICA maps) and then
              conducting a connectivity analysis between the nodes, based on
              the FMRI timeseries associated with the nodes. Analysis methods
              range from very simple measures that consider just two nodes at a
              time (e.g., correlation between two nodes' timeseries) to
              sophisticated approaches that consider all nodes simultaneously
              and estimate one global network model (e.g., Bayes net models).
              Many different methods are being used in the literature, but
              almost none has been carefully validated or compared for use on
              FMRI timeseries data. In this work we generate rich, realistic
              simulated FMRI data for a wide range of underlying networks,
              experimental protocols and problematic confounds in the data, in
              order to compare different connectivity estimation approaches.
              Our results show that in general correlation-based approaches can
              be quite successful, methods based on higher-order statistics are
              less sensitive, and lag-based approaches perform very poorly.
              More specifically: there are several methods that can give high
              sensitivity to network connection detection on good quality FMRI
              data, in particular, partial correlation, regularised inverse
              covariance estimation and several Bayes net methods; however,
              accurate estimation of connection directionality is more
              difficult to achieve, though Patel's $\tau$ can be reasonably
              successful. With respect to the various confounds added to the
              data, the most striking result was that the use of functionally
              inaccurate ROIs (when defining the network nodes and extracting
              their associated timeseries) is extremely damaging to network
              estimation; hence, results derived from inappropriate ROI
              definition (such as via structural atlases) should be regarded
              with great caution.",

  abstract = "Functional neuroimaging has made fundamental contributions to our
              understanding of brain function. It remains challenging, however,
              to translate these advances into diagnostic tools for psychiatry.
              Promising new avenues for translation are provided by
              computational modeling of neuroimaging data. This article reviews
              contemporary frameworks for computational neuroimaging, with a
              focus on forward models linking unobservable brain states to
              measurements. These approaches-biophysical network models,
              generative models, and model-based fMRI analyses of
              neuromodulation-strive to move beyond statistical
              characterizations and toward mechanistic explanations of
              neuroimaging data. Focusing on schizophrenia as a paradigmatic
              spectrum disease, we review applications of these models to
              psychiatric questions, identify methodological challenges, and
              highlight trends of convergence among computational neuroimaging
              approaches. We conclude by outlining a translational
              neuromodeling strategy, highlighting the importance of openly
              available datasets from prospective patient studies for
              evaluating the clinical utility of computational models.",
