               substances. After a hiatus of about 50 years, state-of-the art
               studies have recently begun to close important knowledge gaps by
               elucidating the mechanisms of action of psychedelics with regard
               to their effects on receptor subsystems, systems-level brain
               activity and connectivity, and cognitive and emotional
               processing. In addition, functional studies have shown that
               changes in self-experience, emotional processing and social
               cognition may contribute to the potential therapeutic effects of
               psychedelics. These discoveries provide a scientific road map

  author    = "Olson, David E",
  abstract  = "Psychedelics represent one of the most promising classes of
               experimental medicines for the treatment of neuropsychiatric
               disorders due to their ability to promote neural plasticity and
               produce both rapid and sustained therapeutic effects following a
               single administration. Conventional wisdom holds that peak
               mystical experiences induced by psychedelics are a critical
               component of their therapeutic mechanisms of action, though
               evidence supporting that claim is largely correlational. Here, I
               present data suggesting that the subjective effects induced by
               psychedelics may not be necessary to produce long-lasting
               changes in mood and behavior. Understanding the role of
               subjective effects in the therapeutic mechanisms of psychedelics
               will have important implications for both basic neuroscience and
               for increasing patient access to the next generation of
               medicines developed as a result of psychedelic research.",

@ARTICLE{Carhart-Harris2019-dq,
  title     = "{REBUS} and the Anarchic Brain: Toward a Unified Model of the
               Brain Action of Psychedelics",
  author    = "Carhart-Harris, R L and Friston, K J",
  abstract  = "This paper formulates the action of psychedelics by integrating
               the free-energy principle and entropic brain hypothesis. We call
               this formulation relaxed beliefs under psychedelics (REBUS) and
               the anarchic brain, founded on the principle that---via their
               entropic effect on spontaneous cortical activity---psychedelics
               work to relax the precision of high-level priors or beliefs,
               thereby liberating bottom-up information flow, particularly via
               intrinsic sources such as the limbic system. We assemble
               evidence for this model and show how it can explain a broad
               range of phenomena associated with the psychedelic experience.
               With regard to their potential therapeutic use, we propose that
               psychedelics work to relax the precision weighting of
               pathologically overweighted priors underpinning various
               expressions of mental illness. We propose that this process
               entails an increased sensitization of high-level priors to
               bottom-up signaling (stemming from intrinsic sources), and that
               this heightened sensitivity enables the potential revision and
               deweighting of overweighted priors. We end by discussing further
               implications of the model, such as that psychedelics can bring
               about the revision of other heavily weighted high-level priors,
               not directly related to mental health, such as those underlying
               partisan and/or overly-confident political, religious, and/or
               philosophical perspectives.Significance Statement Psychedelics
               are capturing interest, with efforts underway to bring
               psilocybin therapy to marketing authorisation and legal access
               within a decade, spearheaded by the findings of a series of
               phase 2 trials. In this climate, a compelling unified model of
               how psychedelics alter brain function to alter consciousness
               would have appeal. Towards this end, we have sought to integrate
               a leading model of global brain function, hierarchical
               predictive coding, with an often-cited model of the acute action
               of psychedelics, the entropic brain hypothesis. The resulting
               synthesis states that psychedelics work to relax high-level
               priors, sensitising them to liberated bottom-up information
               flow, which, with the right intention, care provision and
               context, can help guide and cultivate the revision of entrenched
               pathological priors.",
